When we received the closing disclosure, it was a XXXX ARM, we immediately requested that it be corrected to the 30yr fixed we decided upon but they kept delaying and saying it was changed but would n\\'t send it to us. They waited until the next day and then tried to convince us to waive our rights so it would n\\'t push the closing date due to the 3 day clock reset.

During our relations she promised me she was diligently going to see if she could get my business funding with Chase, I was asking for a XXXX loan. After waiting weeks for a return call regarding her promise, I never heard back from her to this day. Without funding from Chase, we were left with no choice to get a $ XXXX loan from XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, WI ( formerly known as Chase Bank! ) for 33 % interest and our 2 XXXX XXXX motorcycles as collateral.Our thoughts are to pay that loan in the shortest time possible once we are able to open our doors for revenue. This money now was not only the money we needed but it also has $ XXXX of our property tied to it.4 days before we were to secure the loan I opted to open my business checking account with XXXX at the 2nd Chase branch in XXXX XXXX , WI. We did not want to sign for that loan but we needed to, to complete my business plan purchase. The ACH deposit happened XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX explained I would be able to get a $ XXXXcashiers check as soon as the funds were showing in my account. I checked my account Friday morning and the loan deposit was successful. I did n\\'t make it to the bank Friday, so I went to Chase Bank Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX before we headed to Illinois to purchase and move my XXXX. Chase did NOT have any hold on my business funds until XXXX decided to put a \" suspicious activity alert \\'\\' on my business checking account making those funds unavailable to me. She ALONE sabotaged my move that was very time sensitive and prescheduled. She vindictively made my funds unavailable to me out of spite, she apparently was upset because I chose a different Chase branch to open my small business checking account. The money that was deposited was an ACH deposit from XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, WI formerly known as Chase bank. The deposit was cleared and considered hard cash deposit when I went into her branch for a cashiers check for the deposit of my XXXX XXXX purchase. This was supposed to happen XX/XX/XXXX at  XXXX in Illinois to move the XXXX to XXXX, WI. The move needed to be done in a 2 day process as XXXX. pieces of equipment and the entire XXXX was being moved 2 hours away. She told me I could not get the {$5800.00} and could not explain why. I was wearing a distinctive bright blue XXXX jogging suit, not knowing when left the branch without my deposit, she put an \" suspicious activity alert \\'\\' on my account with my description and copy of DL! She said she was going to call customer service and that she would call me back as we headed to Illinois. Being a Saturday banks were only open until XXXX. She had n\\'t called me back, so at XXXX on my way to Illinois to purchase my dream, I opted to stop at the XXXX XXXX , WI Chase bank to attempt to get the deposit I needed. I was greeted with EVERY teller \\'s eye contact and as I was waiting to see a teller, the branch manager says \" everything ok ma\\'am? \\'\\' I turned around and responded \" yes, I \\'m fine \\'\\' and I pondered on his attentiveness as well ... Note : bright blue jogging suit. Still not knowing that XXXX placed a flag on me, I turned around to the branch manager and asked \" Maybe you can help me, I \\'m having a problem getting a cashiers check from my business account \\'\\'. While sitting in his cubicle explaining the problem getting the deposit check he continued to gaze at his computer and interrogate me on my intentions of my money! At this point I was still unaware of the \" suspicious activity \\'\\' alert XXXX placed on my account making MY business money inaccessible! I opted to speaker phone the XXXX owner I was on my way to meet in IL and asked if we could just transfer the money into HIS Chase account. The XXXX XXXX, WI manager interrupted us and said \" well, wait, you need XXXX cash? \\'\\' On speaker phone, XXXX and I say fine, cash is king! The banker said \" ok i will get your cash \\'\\'. I preferred a check but I hung up with XXXX and said I would be back on my way with XXXX cash. I patiently waited 6-7 minutes, anxious to be on my way to meet XXXX, movers, equipment technicians, friends and buy my dream. The manager comes back with his little green bank bag, placed it on his desk and said \" yeah, this is n\\'t going to happen today. You will have to go back to the XXXX XXXX branch that you opened your account at. \\'\\' I said \" WHAT! I am on my way to Illinois and it \\'s almost XXXX, I ca n\\'t go back to XXXX XXXX! This is a Chase Bank right?! \\'\\' He again says \" yeah, all I can tell you is go back to the XXXX XXXX location \\'\\' I started balling and literally shaking asking \" Why?? I ca n\\'t move the XXXX unless I have the deposit! \\'\\' Why would n\\'t they even do the internal Chase transfer?!!! A second female banker comes over and says \" Ma\\'am we need you to stop crying we have other customers in here and we are going to ask you to leave or we will call the cops. \\'\\'!!!!!!!! I now feel like a criminal not on my way to be a business owner! I also have held a personal checking account with Chase for years. I was supposed to feel like a business owner, not a suspicious activity character!!!! I called XXXX as I continued to Illinois and asked if she put a hold on my account. She explained \" Well, because when a large ( XXXX?? ) Deposit is made on a business account and a request for a large ( XXXX?? ) Withdrawal is made it \\'s considered suspicious activity. \\'\\' REALLY!!! XXXX knew over the past 6 months that I was trying to open my business! How is that suspicious! Chase was showing the funds available but she decided to change that because I opted to open my account with a different branch. She opted to put her hands on my business money that was secured by our 2 XXXX XXXX motorcycles, blood money really! She costs me thousands in lost deposits, last minute rearranging movers and trucks, turned into a 5 day move that was scheduled 2, additional expenses, 2+ weeks lost revenue, delay in opening my doors, and interest charges on the personal credit cards I had to use to buy and move my business!!!!! That \\'s not to mention how degraded I was made feel at the XXXX XXXX branch and my sanity! She cost me at least $ XXXX and I am now struggling to get my business open! I also quit working to open my XXXX! This was not how I was supposed to start my business and I trusted my business account with Chase. XXXX made a very bad decision and sabotaged my business move plan. After filing a complaint with Chase Executive office, they told me there was nothing they were going to do and told me there was no hold on my money but could n\\'t give me an answer as to why I could n\\'t get my money at 2 Chase locations! If Chase condones her behavior then they are equally responsible for the damages she caused.

On Friday XX/XX/XXXX I called Barclays and reported the fraudulent charge and my credit card was cancelled and I was sent a new credit card. This was a pleasant phone call. On Tuesday XX/XX/2018 at XXXX XXXX I received a phone call on a recorded line from a fraud investigator from Barclays. I believe that I offended him when I asked him some questions to verify who he was because he started asking personal questions. The person was rude and accusatory. Though I repeatedly on the recorded line told him that I had nothing to do with the fraudulent charge he said he could not accept the charge as fraud. The conversation became unpleasant and I ended it. I called back a few minutes later and spoke with another fraud representative and that person reviewed the recorded conversation and came back on the line and apologized and said that she did believe the charge was fraud and stated that my account would be noted. On Monday XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Barclays dated XX/XX/2018 stating that the {$160.00} charge by XXXX was valid. I called Barclays again and unfortunately I was connected with another rude and accusatory fraud investigator. He many times did not let me finish my sentence. He eventually read the notes and listed to both conversations from my previous calls and removed the fraudulent charge. In addition to being rude and accusatory he was condescending. The fraud \" investigators \\'\\' are poorly trained and not very good at their job if they though that this {$160.00} charge from a company based on another continent was a valid charge.

       " \"In XX/XX/XXXX, I fell behind in my mortgage payment since my income with my new employer was less than my previous employer. I had been a political appointee and with the change of the Governor and his new admin., I decided to use the guidance of an outside firm to assist me with getting a loan modification with my present lender, Wells Fargo Home Mortgage Company . I felt that I needed to have an outside firm assist me with communicating with Wells Fargo to submit the required documentation for a loan modification because in XX/XX/XXXX I called Wells Fargo Hm. Mortgage Co. several times and they were not consumer friendly at all. In fact the representatives that I spoke to were abrupt and made it difficult for me to receive the information that I needed to apply for a loan modification. The representatives from Wells Fargo were intimidating and did not respond to my questions and I was dismissed in my efforts to gather the information for their process. On a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 representing being helpful, Wells Fargo was a minus 10. The company that was assisting me was named XXXX XXXX. XXXX assisted me with gathering the financial documents that I would need for consideration and they communicated directly with Wells Fargo on my behalf and my package was submitted by XXXX XXXX to Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX. My ex Fiance had moved out of the home in XX/XX/XXXX and moved to another State and purchased another home. In XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo contacted XXXX and requested a quit claim deed be signed by my ex partner and recorded in court. I made an effort to take this signed quit claim deed to the court house as instructed and the XXXX XXXX XXXX County courthouse indicated that property taxes had to be paid and the cost was about {$5500.00}. and some change. I did not have {$5500.00}. to pay the court to get the quit claim deed recorded and i explained that if I had {$5500.00}. that I would have paid that towards the arrearage to bring my loan current. My home preservation specialist at that time that was assigned to me by Wells Fargo was XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo closed my file and refused to review my documents that were submitted because they said that their policy was that the quit claim deed HAD TO BE RECORDED. So I was denied at that point and I contacted XXXX XXXX to make the request for Wells Fargo to make an exception. I had tried to go to the court house and had received a copy of the invoice from the court and also sent a copy as proof that I had been there as the invoice was stamped with the date and time. XXXX 's response to me was that he would have to speak to the investor of the loan which was XXXX. XXXX XXXX to determine if they would agree to review my file. At this point, I was assigned a home preservation specialist in the Office of the President named XXXX XXXX. When I had my first conversation with XXXX XXXX he was very rude, combative and unbending. He also raised his voice during my very first conversation with him. I was also introduced to the Office Manager named XXXX XXXX who was very professional. I told XXXX XXXX how unprofessional XXXX XXXX was and how verbally abusive he was especially to be working and representing the Office of the President with Wells Fargo. XXXX XXXX offered to reassign another XXXX however, the process had been dragging on and I felt that it would postpone and delay a response from Wells Fargo even in as much I wanted to have a rep. that genuinely cared about the customer and XXXX XXXX spoke with negative language such as short sale and foreclosure rather than try to look for a positive solution. During my conversation with XXXX XXXX, he went on to say to the rep. at XXXX ( in a separate conversation ) who also felt that XXXX XXXX was very combative, that I was behind in my property taxes that are by the way escrowed and paid by Wells Fargo which is why the {$5500.00}. was due. This was far from the truth. In fact, XXXX XXXX and I spoke and she stated that she researched it with the taxed dept. and it was concluded that the burden of responsibility was on Wells Fargo and that they had to pay the $ XXXX.in order to get the quit claim deed recorded. XXXX XXXX stated that I was absolutely correct in stating that I was not behind in my property taxes like XXXX XXXX had raised his voice and said and that Wells Fargo 's position was that they would have to make a special request to XXXX XXXX XXXX County court to send them an invoice earlier than normal and that was what they were moving towards. XXXX XXXX did state that she was not a home preservation specialist but she was trying to assist me. Another week passed and suddenly Wells Fargo decided to move forward with reviewing my file and made a decision to reopen my file for a decision. Something in the back of my mind told me not to trust Wells Fargo because after several weeks of demanding a quit claim deed that had to be recorded before they would even consider reviewing my file, XXXX XXXX stated that Wells Fargo decided that they did not even need the quit claim deed and now they were going to make a decision without a recorded deed. When Wells Fargo thought it was my responsibility to pay the {$5500.00}. and get a recorded deed, they were very demanding and to the point of being down right rude about their position as this was their policy! So now since the burden was on them, their decision was to completely forget about the quit claim deed and XXXX did not even try to pay it but threw the idea to the curb as now it was no longer their policy in order to review my file after giving me XXXX for this so called policy since XX/XX/XXXX and now it is XX/XX/XXXX. and I have been waiting for a response from them for weeks. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX sent me an email stating that Wells Fargo made a decision in hopes that I would call him. XXXX XXXX did not even have the decency to pick up the phone to discuss the matter nor was he helpful with alternative options. I am convinced that XXXX XXXX was born without a heart and lacks the manners of someone who said his desk was in the Office of The President. He should work in a mail room sorting mail as long as he does n't have to communicate with people or be heard. XXXX XXXX stated that he wanted to help me. He followed that statement with I could do a short sale, bring my mortgage up to date and at that point I told XXXX XXXX that I was getting off of the phone because he seemed to gloat in wanting to see my home go into foreclosure. XXXX XXXX just stated that my case was denied due to lack of income. Wells Fargo could have granted a loan modification but I assume with all of the hefty fines, they want to continue to be as deceptive as they always have been. Understanding all of the complaints of fraud committed towards consumers by Wells Fargo over the years, it would seem that Wells Fargo would be motivated to coming up with alternative options and solutions to help their customers instead of using threatening tomes and verbiage with their customers and mainly to adhere to policies of the processes for their programs instead of making policies up as they go along. Their policies are situational. I intend to bring my past dues up to date and attempted to speak to a representative in the Office of the President named XXXX XXXX to have her note that in my file. XXXX XXXX responded to me that she could not note my file because I was calling from work and I did not have my mortgage account number with me at the time and that she COULD NOT locate my file without the account number even though I said I could provide my social security number and complete address. And yet this woman also worked in the Office of the President as Wells Fargo!!! This is unheard of to receive this kind of disparate treatment. I am convinced that Wells Fargo discriminates against single women, especially XXXX XXXX women. So I will have to call again today on XX/XX/XXXX to make an effort to get my intent to pay my past due amount documented in my file. XXXX XXXX did not even care or lift a finger to assist me. She said she could not do it..\",\n",

       " 'Over the last few years, especially since Navient took over, I have had repeated issues with my private, and recently federal, loans from XXXX  school ( XXXX ). My private loans have been in repayment for years, and at least once a year, Navient redirects the funds to other loans. Even when my federal loan was in economic hardship forbearance ( meaning not in repayment ), they directed private loan monies to the federal loan. Then they harassingly call me ( and my elderly father as co-signer ) to say I\\'m delinquent when it is their mistake is misappropriating my payment. It is SO FRUSTRATING!! It just happened again. Now that my federal loan is in repayment they misappropriated those monies as well. I am never told the same thing twice by any representatives. I brought my federal loan current in XX/XX/XXXX and then started its repayment, only to be told yesterday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) that the representative gave my the wrong amount to bring it current and that I have been charged late fees since XX/XX/XXXX on an amount I never knew was outstanding. It just can\\'t be right. The private and federal departments are separate and seem unable to speak to one another when these issues arise making it almost impossible to resolve these errors. I was on the phone yesterday for 2 hours and 11 minutes - only to learn that, again, they had moved the money to the wrong account. I can not help but wonder if there is something illegal going on ...? They also keep suggesting that I directly deposit to them to make things easier ; or make my payments through their website. Like I would ever let them be in charge of my money. They do not know what they are doing. It really is criminal. In fact, yesterday, when I forced them to go over the details of my accounts and payment history, they informed me that one on my private loans was paid. They never let me know and payments kept electronically going to that account. They said they were just applying them to another loan group. How is this possible?? I keep threatening to get a lawyer every time I speak to them. It really is unconscionable the way they handle this business. I was also told yesterday ( XX/XX/XXXX) that when I over pay my loan amounts it makes it \" harder for them to know where the money should go \\'\\'. Seriously? Isn\\'t that what account numbers are for? Everyone knows that one of the first things you do as a student borrower is to over pay as able to decrease the amount of time you are in repayment. To me, it seems that Navient \\'s representatives are suggesting that I keep my payments lower to increase the amount of interest I accrue and therefore have to pay them. Bad advice - and maybe illegal to suggest ...? I am a medical professional and have run a successful practice for the last ten years. I can not believe how demeaning it is to deal with Navient. It just has to stop. For me, yesterday was the last straw. I have these loans because I have a profession that I love and spend my life helping others.

First of all they are not allowed to collect in my state. They called me harassing me over the phone.

I have no contract with them and have never given them my personal information i.e. social security number etc. Please see the below information from the FTC, clearly they are still in violation : A Memphis-based debt collector has agreed to stop deceiving and harassing consumers and otherwise violating federal debt collection laws, and will pay a {$1.00} XXXX civil penalty to settle Federal Trade Commission charges, while a debt collection operation headquartered outside XXXX XXXX will pay {$490000.00} as a penalty to settle a separate FTC complaint. \" The FTC is committed to protecting consumers from all types of deceptive and harassing debt collection tactics, \\'\\' said XXXX Director of the XXXX. XXXX In its complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX, the FTC charges that the XXXX-based company used unfair and deceptive collection tactics, such as repeatedly calling consumers and accusing them of owing debts that they did not owe, contacting consumers at work while knowing that their employers did not allow the calls, making unauthorized withdrawals from consumers \\' bank accounts, and disclosing confidential information about debtors to third parties. The company collects on about a XXXX consumer accounts a year and is charged with violating the FTC Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). Under the proposed order settling the FTC \\'s charges XXXX is permanently prohibited from engaging in false, deceptive, unfair, and harassing debt collection practices. The order requires the company to address specific problematic conduct alleged in the XXXX complaint -- whenever a consumer disputes the validity or the amount of a debt, XXXX must either close the account and end its collection efforts, or suspend collection, until it has conducted a reasonable investigation and verified that the information about the debt is accurate and complete. The order also restricts situations in which the company can leave voicemails that disclose the alleged debtor \\'s name and the fact that he or she may owe a debt. The XXXX is grateful for the critical assistance provided by the Tennessee State Attorney General \\'s Office during the course of its investigation of this matter.',\n",

       " 'On XX/XX/XXXX I deposited a check in the amount of XXXX dollars. I had a very difficult financial month and really needed this money. I deposited my check into my Bank of America account, which is the only bank I use and have used them since I started banking. Normally their policy is to approve and clear a portion of the funds ( usually half the check ) and then within 2 business days ( sometimes more depending on if its a weekend ) they will clear the rest of the funds. Not only did they not do this but they placed a hold on my account, the atm ate my card, and they said theyre withholding the check funds until XX/XX/XXXX. This was frustrating for two reasons. It went against their normal policy ( Ive deposited checks before and it never does this ), and they put my account on hold and took my debit card. Leaving me stranded all weekend with no way to buy food or make any necessary arrangements. I also drive for work so this prevented me working because I couldnt purchase gas. When I went in Monday, the banker assured me my check would clear by the next business day and assigned me a temporary debit card while a new one was being mailed to me. Tuesday comes and not even a portion of the check has cleared. Wednesday rolls around and nothing has cleared. And on top of that not clearing they have approved an automated payment for which I had insufficient funds to cover. This puts me into overdraft and charges me a fee. Finally Thursday comes and half the check has cleared. This put my account in good standing but of course I lost money on fees that werent returned to me. I took my car in to get repaired. They put a hold on my account that Friday because they said the transaction was too large for a temporary card ( despite the fact I had sufficient funds to cover such a transaction ). I go into the financial center the next day right as they open. I notice something strange when speaking to the banker. I notice it said I had over 800 dollars in my account but on my online banking app it said I had XXXX. I felt that was odd but I didnt press it at the time. I should have. But I deferred to what my online banking app said and used that as my reference point for purchases. The banker gave me a new temporary card and told me that the remaining half of my funds will be delivered on XX/XX/XXXX. Now at this time all transactions that went through that past week including clearing half of my check had all processed and cleared on my online banking app. I was even charged overdraft fees for the automated payment on Wednesday. None of that was returned and all transactions had cleared. Well much to my surprised early Monday morning I again had to cut Work short because I was unable to pay for gas. Why? I check my online banking app and its like revisionist history. Now my online banking app said that they initially cleared the entire check ( which as I mentioned earlier initially they cleared nothing ), and that later the following week I believe it was Thursday ( the day when my online banking app said half the check cleared ) that they declined the entire check and it was put on hold. It also said that all funds will be released XX/XX/XXXX. But they had already released half of my funds the previous Thursday so why theyre claiming that the check had been returned is still a mystery to me. They also claim that the previous Thursday ( the day after that automated charge threw me into overdraft and charged me a fee ) that they declined that transaction and returned those funds to me on Thursday maybe Friday but it was within 2 business days. However they never did this. None of this was reflected on my online banking app at the time. In fact I was checking it 2-3 times per day to try and prevent further overdrafts and according to my online app everything cleared. So now you can imagine my surprise as I now see my online banking app showing a completely different story. And now Im in overdraft again. Why? Because that initial automated payment has gone through again, but this time theyve also withheld the XXXX dollars from my check that they had originally cleared. This created insufficient funds and now Im in overdraft with fees again. I want them to reverse that charge and I want them to return the check to me so I can cash it someplace else.',\n",

I was told by Seterus there was nowhere to send my trial repayments while the loan was in transfer, and they were not sure whether they would honor the existing loan modification would be honored. <P/>I called repeatedly in the coming months, several times a week, sometimes daily to find out where to continue to send my payments as agreed. At first my records were n't available for what seemed like an inordinate amount of time. Then, once available, no one could find the loan modification paperwork in the transfer documents, nor knew whether the agreement would be honored by Seterus. They continued to advise me not to send in any payments. <P/>After several weeks, Seterus was still unable to find my loan modification paperwork so on XX/XX/XXXX, I faxed them a copy of the loan modification letter I received ( see attached ). Weeks after faxing it they said they must still be processing the document because they could not find it. ( I was told later they coded it under an incorrect title -- and every time I called could not find it. ) I continued to call daily but never received any definitive answer on what would happen with my loan or loan modification. While it was still in a foreclosure state, they would not accept any payments. I was in long-term limbo. <P/>After several unsuccessful months of frustrating phone calls, hours on the phone, and no results, I ultimately gave up making the calls. For the remainder of the year, I did not receive any communication from Seterus, aside from a monthly paper bill showing the total arrears ( which I could not resolve ) and under the direction NOT to send in the monthly mortgage payment. My hands were tied. <P/>Without warning, in XX/XX/XXXX I received a Foreclosure Sale Date of XX/XX/XXXX with less than 30 days to make good on the loan. I immediately called Seterus and was told the policy had been established that loan modifications in progress at the time of transfer would not be honored by Seterus. I would have to apply for a loan modification again, and there was no guarantee given the short window of time that it would be processed ( or approved ) before the Foreclosure Sale Date. However, they said if I could get everything in, they could possibly expedite it in 15 business days. <P/>I mobilized, prepared and uploaded all documents requested as quickly as possible, and uploaded them by XX/XX/XXXX. I confirmed receipt by phone, and was told electronic signatures were sufficient. I called daily to check on progress -- waiting again. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that electronic signatures were not sufficient ( even though I was told twice Seterus had everything they needed to advance the loan mod packet, including the electronic signatures ) so no processing had begun yet. They made no attempt to inform me of the new requirement for the wet signature, even though I asked them to phone, email, or use their proprietary email system to notify me immediately of anything else they needed. I resubmitted paperwork within 4 hours with wet signatures. <P/>I was also told that a new policy, effective immediately, required 37 days to process any loan mods. I requested that they consider expediting my application with the Foreclosure Sale Date so near, given my circumstances. <P/>On XX/XX/XXXX, I was told the package was reviewed in part by Loss Mitigation, but would take more time. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that the package was still in review. I requested it be expedited. I am still waiting to hear. <P/>I have been calling daily, at times twice daily, to find out if there any any updates on a new loan modification. I am hopeful Seterus will process my loan modification with a positive outcome, but time is running out. I am not sure what I will do if they do not push the Foreclosure Sale Date out, or decide at the last minute the loan modification will not be an option.

So with no monthly statements & lousy customer service we stated on more then one occasion that we are trying to establish a business relationship with a company that we have no knowledge of who they are. Statements are one way to do that & allows us the proper documentation we need to support our loan. We realized they are not compliant & of course we did not want to put our home in jeopardy so we made payments late but through our bank. Then we started to notice phone calls come in with no messages from the StateBridge # on our caller Id in fact one @ XXXX. Yet no messages or statement however oddly enough a couple of mailings offering mortgage assistance. So after months of no contact a phone call with a message from what sounded like a guy talking throw a microphone at a XXXX drive thru stating he needed to speak with my husband about an important matter. WOO HOO I can not wait to call him back to bad he did not leave an extension but lucky me I got XXXX XXXX on the phone, after I told her that I had not received any statements. She told me that it was because I filed for bankruptcy. I informed her that it was discharged years ago & my home was not part of the bankruptcy. She proceeded to inform me that if I know I owe a mortgage then regardless I should just pay it like I did to my previous lender. I explained that I had a relationship with that lender & I received statements monthly unlike STATEBRIDGE. Then I was told I in order for them to send me statements that I needed to give them permission because of the bankruptcy. So I said OK after I was verbal mistreated I told her my loan should be current except for XX/XX/XXXX as I just made my XX/XX/XXXX payment. I was then told that I owed them for XX/XX/XXXX, WHAT! I paid that to the previous lender, your problem not mine. Once again upset I told the rep I did but to the previous lender. So I was told I needed to call them & get my money back to pay them. Really no I have to do their job I am not employed but Statebridge. Somewhere she realized something & changed her tone & decided to email all my payments to review. I then call my previous lender who has great customer service & they explained what they told me & they reassured me that it was paid & it was part of the sale & they would send expedited correspondence to StateBridge to resolve the matter.

This does not meet the Federal Trade Commissions guidelines of what constitutes proper debt validation In addition, in the case of XXXX XXXX XXXX ( IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA, No. XXXX ), the court ruled that : 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ( emphasis added ). On XX/XX/XXXX, nineteen days after the date of XXXX   debt collection letter, XXXX counsel XXXX  sent XXXX  a letter declaring that XXXX disputes your debt collection-related allegations, denies the same, and demands strict proof and verification thereof. Record at XXXX. As such, XXXX should have ceased his debt collection efforts immediately upon receiving that letter. Instead, XXXX proceeded to obtain a default judgment against XXXX  on the debt collection claim before he had mailed XXXX the necessary verification and, thus, violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ).\\n\\nXXXX maintains, however, that there was no violation of the FDCPA because he sent adequate verification of the debt [ to XXXX ] in the XX/XX/XXXX notice of claim. Brief of Appellee at XXXX. Specifically, XXXX  claims that a copy of the consumer credit contract between XXXX and XXXX XXXX   attached to the notice of claim provided sufficient verification of the debt within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). We can not agree.\\n\\nThe contract in no way provides sufficient verification of the debt. A review of the document reveals that it identifies only the terms of XXXX  loan, including a 17.99 % annual interest rate and the original loan amount of {$2500.00}. The loan agreement contains no accounting of any payments made by XXXX, the dates on which those payments were made, the interest which had accrued, or any late fees which had been assessed once XXXX   stopped making the required payments. Indeed, the existing unpaid contract balance at the time XXXX sent the debt collection notice was at least {$350.00} more than the original loan amount. Therefore, Brennan violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) when he failed to cease collection of the debt by obtaining a default judgment against XXXX  after XXXX  had notified XXXX in writing that he was disputing the debt but before XXXX had mailed verification of the debt to XXXX. We reverse the trial courts entry of summary judgment in favor of XXXX on this issue.\\n\\nI notice that you are still reporting this collection on my credit report, which is considered to be a collection activity. You are now in violation of the FCPDA, and are now subject to fines of {$1000.00}, plus actual damages and attorneys fees, which I may collect from you by filing a claim in small claims court. These collections on my credit report are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ 1000s.\\n\\nYou should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information to major credit bureaus might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} fine, plus punitive damages.

They will be directly involved if they continue to lie as they did so far. I will never be intimidated never. XXXX stole all my private property for which no Financial Institution was ever involved. I expect CFPB to force this Law Firm to reply  before a massive penalty will fallow. This Law Firm disrespect CFPB as well as many families. How many more criminal activity needs this Law Firm to do before we can close permanently their filthy activity of lying, deceiving, degrading people. Why we spend a lot of money fighting XXXX when we have them doing more criminal activity inside the country against American families. Why is so privilege such a filthy  company that abuse people? I filed 287 complaints against them and I will continue to write complains against them until I win my legal case. Next week I will go to the Supreme Court and I WILL NEVER EVER STOP until their filthy  lying lawyer will no longer have license to lie inside the courts. I will never stop NEVER until this filthy company is out of business and the layers involved in defrauding my property for which I do not have any mortgage will go to prison. As for the forge documents used by XXXX want to clarify the fact that the documents sent to foreclose on my property are forge document. Each document has an XXXX address and I sent this forge document to see from where this XXXX address came from so I can file criminal charges to that XXXX address user tooWhat is the difference between a mortgage and a Promissory Note? Homebuyers sometimes think of the mortgage ( or deed of trust ) as the contract they are signing with the bank to borrow money to purchase a house, but it is the promissory note that contains the promise to repay the amount borrowed. A mortgage note ( also known as a real estate lien note, borrower \\'s note ) is a promissory note secured by a specified mortgage loan. Mortgage notes are a written promise to repay a specified sum of money plus interest at a specified rate and length of time to fulfill the promise. The mortgage note states the amount of debt and the rate of interest, and obligates the borrower, who signs the note, personally responsible for repayment. Without a promissory note, a foreclosing plaintiff can not show a legal injury, i.e., does not have standing to sue. Without standing, the action before the court does not qualify as a \" case or controversy \\'\\' under Article III of the constitution. Courts can only make rulings on \" cases or controversies ; \\'\\' advisory opinions are a legal nullity. Consequently, a court that purports to enter a \" judgment \\'\\' where it has no subject matter jurisdiction has in fact entered a legal nullity on its docket ; that \" judgment \\'\\' is void as a matter of law. As such, any such \" judgment \\'\\' entered where the plaintiff had no standing is open to collateral attack in any subsequent proceeding. What is more, subject matter jurisdiction can not be waived ; were that the case, parties could falsely induce courts to make binding rulings -- obviously non-sensical. In essence, the ruling upheld that those who had purchased foreclosure properties that had been illegally foreclosed upon did not in fact have title to those properties.

He said it would take up to 90 days to be resolved from the XX/XX/XXXX dispute date ( unknown reference date ) and since it is a dispute, no charges will be refunded until the 90 days have expired. I asked what had happened to the previous dispute that was again filed on XX/XX/XXXX for the same charge and he put me on hold again. He came back on the line and said it could take up to 60 days to get a temporary credit and the interest charges and withdrawal fees would be credited when fully proven. He stated the next investigation started on XX/XX/XXXX.\\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX  from USAA called to go over the fraud claim and wanted some additional information.

XXXX stated the original fraud claim was made on XX/XX/XXXX; however, since the fraud systems changed about a year ago, she was unable to look at thorough notes from previous to the system change. XXXX   stated this was most likely an in-person transaction. If it was through an ATM, they would have had to had a PIN number for the card ( I did not have a PIN for the card ) ; most likely they would have had to go into the bank.

The rep never said the words rebate. Rebate would have signified to me that I would get money back after the loan is paid off. But she said discount.

About XXXX months ago ( or more ) my wife and I rolled over a retirement account into XXXX XXXX to ensure that we met the XXXX threshold. The rollover was done with a Merrill XXXX representative who was informed what we were doing and the fact that the only reason we were rolling the funds over was to qualify for the program.

Initially, we were told that it took a couple of weeks more than the XXXX period to qualify, so we decided to wait a couple of weeks, and when nothing happened called again. We were then told that the reason why the accounts were not showing as qualifying for preferred rewards was because we needed to change my wife \\'s maiden to her new married last name ( something we should have been told months ago but were not ), so we submitted all the paperwork to have her last name changed and the representative informed me she would call me back in XXXX days. XXXX weeks later she had yet to call.

The man from Student Assist Plus told me that XXXX is just trying to scare me into paying my loans through them and ask me to fax the papers XXXX sent me. So I did and never heard anything from them. Well this time around XXXX calls again and says the same thing my loans are up for payment.

       " 'Summary : Discover Card closes account on first-class, long-term customer with excellent FICO score, for simply having \" inactivity \\'\\' on account. \\n\\nI have had my Discover Card in question since 1995 ( 21 years ). I not only have an excellent history directly with Discover, but also have a very high FICO score which recently ranges from XXXX to XXXX ( with XXXX max ). On or about XXXX XXXX, I received a letter from Discover informing me that my account was suspended and would be closed within 30 days. The letter states that the closure was due to \" Inactivity on your account. \\'\\' I then tried to use my credit card for a purchase, but the card was denied in the system, per the merchant. On XXXX XXXX and on XXXX XXXX, I spoke to a Supervisor using the card \\'s normal customer service phone number ; neither could assist to re-instate the card. \\n\\nThrough online research conducted on my own, I found that Discover had a department called the \" Executive Office of Customer Advocacy. \\'\\' I thought this dept would handle my concern in a more \" independent \\'\\' manner, but I was mistaken. My assigned rep in this dept was XXXX XXXX. I explained to XXXX XXXX, that I thought I was being treated in an unjust manner as a long-term customer of Discover. For someone to have their account closed without any recourse, for simply not having any recent activity seemed unfair and silly. This has happened before, with other credit cards I own, and with all other credit card companies they have immediately allowed the card to be re-instated. \\n\\nOne of my major concerns is that Discover \\'s action to close my account actually hurts my excellent credit score/history. This was not only explained in detail to the two supervisors that I had conversation with, but also with XXXX XXXX. By closing my account with 21 active years, this hurts the \" length of credit history \\'\\' aspect of my credit score. Also, by closing my account with a credit limit of {$12000.00} this also hurts my credit score ; because a person \\'s total amount owed ( on all accounts ) is compared to your overall credit limits on hand. The two supervisors and XXXX XXXX, danced around this issue, and said they could not answer to this concern because they were not a \" credit analyst. \\'\\' This is very basic credit/FICO information, and knowledge that anyone in their ( elevated ) positions should understand. ( The irony is that Discover \\'s widely advertised free ability to show MY credit score on my statement, will now reflect a lower credit score, due to them. ) XXXX XXXX promised to call me back within a short period of time. She never did. In my initial call with her, I explicitly informed her that it was OK to leave a voice mail. After about 13 days or so, I called her and she said that she had attempted to call me. I do not believe she was being honest with me. She then told me over the phone that Discover could not re-instate my account, and that she also sent me a letter stating the same. I had various questions for XXXX XXXX, but instead she gave me vague answers. Most of her responses had little to no connection to the actual questions I was asking. Instead of talking to me as a human being, she danced around the entire topic and conducted herself more like a high-class lawyer. This was a huge disappointment to me. \\n\\nIn conclusion, I am just shocked that Discover Card would treat a customer in this fashion. There is nothing \" negative \\'\\' that I have done wrong. Actually, in my opinion, I would describe the way I have conducted my financial affairs throughout my entire life as near-perfect. I have always treated my credit history and score in a very serious manner. Most credit card companies desire to find and hold customers with excellent credit, but instead Discover rejects individuals like me. For Discover to hurt me and others for simple \" inactivity on account \\'\\' seems to be not only unfair, but unethical and unprofessional.',\n",

Again, weeks later, I received a letter notifying me my application was denied due to insufficient documentation. I called Fed Loan and found it the insufficiency dealt specifically with my wife \\'s income. I was told to submit a letter signed by my wife stating how much money she earns on average and how often. \\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a third verification with a letter signed by my wife detailing her gross business income, gross expenses, and average net take home pay as well as my pay stubs. I also decided to change repayment plans from income based repayment to the REPAYE plan. Finally, weeks later, I received notice my application had been received and was being reviewed. \\nAfter a few more weeks, I called Fed Loan for a status. I was told that it would take about 2 months to review the documentation I submitted to come up with a new payment amount. At this time, because my previous attempts to recertify my income were rejected, I was moved to a standard repayment plan automatically which almost doubled my payment due. I made the payment in XX/XX/XXXX hoping the situation would resolve soon. In XX/XX/XXXX, I requested a forbearance to continue to pay my IBR payment amount. My forbearance request was denied and a direct debit for the full amount, in addition to the reduced payment I had set up was made, i.e. I paid 3 times my normal amount due to the direct debit. When I called Fed Loan, I was informed they rarely gave out refunds for extra payments, but that the rep would put in a request for this situation. I never heard about it again. \\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted another forbearance request and continued waiting for an update. In XX/XX/XXXX, I called for a status and was told I needed to name an interim repayment amount while Fed Loan switched me from IBR to REPAYE. I did this and paid the amount. \\nIn XX/XX/XXXX the new payment amount still had not taken effect. I called Fed Loan again and was told I was close to being complete and that a new amount should show up around my payment date. As I was in forbearance, I made no payment. \\nThen, I received a letter postmarked XXXX XXXX informing me that I owed Fed Loan a payment on XXXX XXXX.

I was told her letter submitted in XX/XX/XXXX contained too much (? ) information and that they only wanted a simple statement of income. They told me to fax in a new application and documentation and wait. I did, and have heard nothing. \\nIt took Fed Loan five months to review the sufficiency of the documentation I submitted in XX/XX/XXXX.

       " 'I write you today to provide with you with information regarding our recent experience with NFCUs loan department. Specifically the level of service we received from XXXX XXXX. After much research about what mortgage companies were available when purchasing our new home, we were excited to learn of the competitive terms that NFCU provided along with the pride in being presented with the opportunity to be a member since both of our Grandfathers served our country in the armed forces. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX was was our initial contact and she has been very helpful in providing loans estimates, monthly payment estimates, etc. She provided us with mortgage rate quotes in the mid 4 % s. \\n\\nThe housing market in Colorado is very competitive, so we wrote up more than 5 contracts before we finally and successfully went under contract on our home. Once we had an executed contract, our file was assigned to XXXX XXXX. Our closing date was nearly 60 days as a result of the sellers moving date. \\n\\nWe provided XXXX with the documentation for our file that she requested as timely as possible and items ( such as an insurance quote ) that couldnt be sent right away were explained and updates were sent to XXXX almost weekly about the status of the documentation and when to expect it. \\n\\nOur loan had a float lock built into it, which gave us the option to monitor interest rates and float down to a lower interest rate within 2 weeks of closing. Over the phone, XXXX said that NFCU would monitor interest rates and let us know should they decrease so we had the opportunity to lock at a lower interest rate. She also asked us to sign disclosures and intents to proceed with NFCU as our lender. In those disclosures, there was language that said that NFCU was no obligation to monitor or notify the borrower of any interest rate changes. I contacted XXXX to get explanation on this issue, because we were told one thing and the paperwork said another. She still said she would monitor the interest rates and let us know. I asked about how we, as the borrowers, could watch the rates ourselves and she directed us to the website, which showed an interest rate 8 percentage points lower than our current one. We asked again for clarification and no response. We were only provided interest rate upon inquiring about them and the float lock passed with radio silence from NFCU. Id go so far as to say we were LIED to about our float lock. Attached is the Fair Lending Compliance Best Practices for Federal Credit Unions. Youll see that the very first bullet under prohibited practices is : Fail to provide information or services or provide different information or services regarding any aspect of the lending process, including credit availability, application procedures, or lending standards. \\n\\nWhen the appraisal of our home, came up short, XXXX sent off a very curt email without sympathy or regard with what that meant for us. You may imagine how heartbreaking it is to get bad news like an appraisal short fall in email from without a phone call or options let alone a little sympathy. XXXX was a great resource for us to talk through our options, etc. \\n\\nWe emailed XXXX about appealing the apprasial and she failed to send us the form required to do so, even after we asked if there was anything else she needed to process said appeal. After our agent contacted NFCU, XXXX finally sent over the required form to initiate that process. We initiated the appraisal appeal because the appraiser failed to include comparable and negotiated the sale price and worked with XXXX to adjust the downpayment on the loan in order for us to purchase the home. \\n\\nFast forward 2 weeks to late XXXX. We hadnt received any response from XXXX or an update on the status of the file. We traveled over the week before XXXX XXXX and we were going to be out of service range so we sent an email to XXXX and XXXX as a courtesy. At the last minute, XXXX responded that she needed another bank statement from me. I sent it immediately. \\n\\nThe last week of XXXX, I hadnt heard anything ( and it was a week before closing ), so I reached out to XXXX via telephone and she said that the file had been sent to closing and they didnt need anything from us. \\n\\nOn Friday XX/XX/XXXX, the deadline for the closing disclosure to be sent, we contact XXXX and XXXX only to learn that XXXX was out of the office. Prior to her being out of the office, she didnt tell us who to contact in her absence. \\n\\nAs someone who is also in the XXXX XXXX industry and thrives on clients and provided a good experience, I cant tell you how disappointed I am with how XXXX conducted herself, her level of communication ( or lack thereof ) and the fact that she blatantly put our file on the back burner knowing that we had a longer closing. That leaves us scrambling and neurotically checking our email for the final piece of our closing puzzle. How embarrassing does it look for us to not have this Disclosure in to the Title Company on time? \\n\\nWhen I sold my home at the end of XXXX we had a 28 day closing and their disclosure was in 10 days prior to closing. There is absolutely not excuse for how long this has taken. \\n\\nAs a professional myself, had I conducted myself the way XXXX had, Id have been sued for my conduct if not fired. \\n\\nHere is a timeline of events : XX/XX/XXXX-Borrowers ( we ) become members of Navy Federal Credit Union XXXX-We go under contract on our home ( we expected to lock interest rates on this day and we do not believe this was the case ) XX/XX/XXXX-Receive an email from XXXX about the process and document delivery system XXXX-Appraisal was ordered XX/XX/XXXX-We are introduced to XXXX as our Loan Processor XX/XX/XXXX-XXXX sent us an email that she was reviewing our file.

In this email, I again asked how we can monitor rates? \\nXX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX, Borrowers call XXXX, left a message, no return phone call XX/XX/XXXX-We emailed XXXX copies of the inspections and amendments to the contract. \\nXXXX-She acknowledged this email and said we could monitor rates online, we checked and those rates were not accurate.

I have multiple emails detailing my notifying National Integrity, National Integrity admitting I was shorted, as well as multiple emails of my requests for information and asking for a recalculation to determine the exact amount I was shorted and for National Integrity to give me my money due. This will be detailed in the following paragraphs : On XX/XX/XXXX, I was one of two sellers of a property on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NJ. National Integrity LLC of XXXX XXXX, NJ handled the settlement transaction and the disbursement of funds. I requested, via email, from both National Integrity and my real estate agent, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX a tentative copy of the settlement papers to review 6 times, once per day, for each of the 6 days leading up to the settlement on XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. These 6 requests were ignored. I asked, again, a 7th time early on the morning of settlement, on XX/XX/XXXX. Again, my request was ignored. \\n\\nAt settlement on XX/XX/XXXX, I was segregated into a different room and was, therefore, not privy to the discussions and explanations regarding the financial calculations. I was not told in advance that I would be excluded from the settlement table. XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX, XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX went back and forth between rooms. She did not provide all the information I requested. Later, she, National Integrity, as well as XXXX and XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX claimed they did not have all the information available to them, such as copies of the final water and sewer bill from the XX/XX/XXXX, although I had the water meter changed and read the previous week ( and they were made aware of this ) and they knew they would need this information for settlement. Additionally, I turned all keys over to XXXX two days prior to settlement, I was also not provided an explanation as to how each year of taxes was calculated from the XXXX paper ( which still has not been explained as the numbers do not match up ). \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, the morning after settlement, I realized two financial mistakes by National Integrity and XXXX ( and notified all via email ) : one of the receipts I submitted via email to National Integrity and XXXX was not included in the settlement calculations and, therefore, I was shorted this reimbursement I should have received at settlement. Further, I also realized a tax credit that I was solely due was not given to me in its entirety. I immediately notified National Integrity and XXXX and asked for a recalculation of the settlement to determine the funds I was shorted and the money I am due. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX provided a rough \" proceeds calculation \\'\\' without any detail as to how National Integrity calculated their \" proceeds before split \\'\\' figure and without a complete recalculation. I notified, via email, National Integrity that their \" proceeds before split \\'\\' figure still appeared to have, erroneously, the tax credit I was solely due included within it. Further, National Integrity was claiming that I would have to be reimbursed the funds National Integrity shorted me due to their financial mistakes by the party to whom they carelessly gave my money to by not properly calculating the settlement. I informed National Integrity and XXXX that this was unacceptable as it was their mistake, and I expected National Integrity to reimburse me directly. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, an unknown person from National Integrity sent me an email, unsigned, and from a general National Integrity email address, stating that I was correct, that I was shorted funds and that a check would be sent out for what I was shorted and due. I was never issued a check and National Integrity never provided me a recalculation with supporting documentation. \\n\\nI continued to request a complete recalculation, including an explanation regarding how the taxes were calculated, via email on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( twice ). On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX /National Integrity again sent a rough calculation without any detail and without line items to verify and which is much less than the amount I already know I was shorted from the receipt and tax credit I should have been solely given ( but was not ). \\n\\nIn total, before and after settlement, I have requested a complete ( re ) calculation of the settlement papers a total of 16 times and have not received such. This is what National Integrity does i.e. calculate settlement proceeds ; I do not. Further, settlement calculations are generated via a computer program that National Integrity has access to and which I do not. Because National Integrity and XXXX refuse to do a complete recalculation, and because of the XX/XX/XXXXemail from National Integrity informing that I a correct that I was shorted funds, it appears there may be more financial errors which I, who am not in this industry, have not discovered. National Integrity should be forthright and open regarding this transaction and should provide a complete recalculation including all figures, calculations, breakdowns and detailed explanations as to how National Integrity arrived at each figure. \\n\\nI think it is reasonable for me to want a detailed recalculation, from National Integrity, of the settlement papers with each and every cost and fee included, showing everything before the proceeds split and every line item deducted from my proceeds, with a clear amount I should have received and a detailed calculation of what I am due. National Integrity, as it was its mistake ( s ), should reimburse me directly and immediately.',\n",

Over the next three years XXXX kept delaying the process by constantly requesting more and more paperwork, different forms, saying the program had changed so they needed all new paper work. While at their instructions I did not make any payments until they gave me a modification offer. This process drug out for about 3 years until in XXXX when I was given an offer that I considered ludicrous. It was NO modification at all. So at that time opted for a short sale. By XXXX XXXX I had an agent who had a buyer for the short sale. XXXX had paid my step son about {$2500.00} \" cash for keys \\'\\' because he was living in the house while I was XXXX. I thought it was a done deal. I learned several months later that XXXX had cancelled the sale in XXXX then foreclosed and sold the property at auction in the \" dark of night \\'\\' without any notification to myself or my agent. I later learned that it was sold to XXXX bank for {$110000.00} on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. XXXX bank is a partner/cousin of XXXX. Sounds like a pretty shady deal to me. I spoke to the foreclosure attorneys who are listed on the court document and they assured me that the foreclosure was completed. The foreclosure was done as a service to \" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' another XXXX company who I understand has been under investigation. So again I thought the property was gone and since I was working XXXX there was nothing I could do about it and just let it go. \\nI returned home to the XXXX at the end of XXXX and was looking for a new place to live. Upon checking my credit I learned that the loan had not been removed at the time of the foreclosure but remained as a big negative mark on my credit file. I also found my house pictured on a real-estate site with the caption \" not for sale \\'\\'. Why was it shown on a real-estate site but not for sale? I contacted the agent listed and was told that they were given the listing by XXXX but the bank kept refusing all offers for the property. More research I came to find out that a company called SPS was now handling the loan. Come to find out that in XXXX at the same time XXXX was having XXXX XXXX foreclose on the property they had also transferred servicing of the loan to SPS as a delinquent loan, NOT a foreclosed loan. SPS knew NOTHING about the foreclosure. When XXXX foreclosed on the property they simply abandon it, \" washed their hands of it \\'\\' then turned it over the XXXX. There was NO oversite or care to the property, allowing damage and vandalism to occur. When I contacted SPS, I was asked if I wanted to begin a loan modification. They apparently had NO record that XXXX had put me through the process 5 years earlier. They were also unaware that I was not living in the house and had been XXXX until XXXX. They told me that the property was indeed mine and I could be living in it. So after consulting a couple of law firms and the XXXX general we moved back in in XXXX, and began again the modification process with SPS. Over the next couple of years I learned what a serious mess this has become. For the first couple years SPS refused to accept the fact that the property had been foreclosed on and that issue needs to be corrected at the XXXX level. The damage that the bank allowed needs to be repaired as well as my credit that has been ruined by the banks actions needs to be corrected. \\nThey have me in a position of not being able to not having the ability to live safely and securely in my home and not being able to buy another home.

( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions.

( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.

       " \"Good Day Sir/Ma'am : My circumstance does not exactly fit into the canned reasons provided in the online complaint application, however I am hoping I can get some assistance with this. As I believe it affects many if not all Consumers.\\n\\n1. On XX/XX/2018, I paid off my family student loan with the U.S. Dept of Education in the amount of {$1200.00}, and made a payment on my XXXX Credit Card in the amount of {$10000.00}, and a subsequent payment of {$350.00} on XX/XX/2018. \\n\\n2. I took these payment measures not only to reduce my debt ratio, but to improve my credit score as well. Just prior to making these payments my credit score for Trans Union was XXXX, and XXXX was XXXX. \\n\\n3. I was shocked and dismayed to find that Trans Union penalized me 16 points off of my score for having paid off my student loan, bring my score to XXXX, and XXXX 1 point down to XXXX. \\n\\n4. This action by me to reduce my debt, and pay off my student debt should have been rewarded by adding points to my score, not deducting points. Especially 16 points down. This is not fair to consumers who are keeping up as best they can with paying their debt down.\\n\\n5. This is a lose/lose situation being perpetrated on Consumers. I can see if the account had to be closed due to non-payment, where collections or a write off of the debt were required. However, this is not the case with me, as it most likely is not the case for many other consumers.\\n\\n6. I am hoping to get credited back the 16 points ( XXXX ) from Trans Union, and have the 16 points added to my original score of XXXX ( XXXX ). Although XXXX was not as harsh, deducting only one point, I feel the direction of the score should have been in the positive to XXXX. \\n\\nIn closing, this is a unfair practice!! So much attention is placed on Consumers being responsible in managing their finances, paying down our debt, maintaining our creditworthiness, and when we do, we are penalized heavily for it ; therefore having negative effects on our credit worthiness.\\n\\nI greatly appreciate your assistance with this matter, as I am sure many other Consumers will. Thank you so much for this opportunity to file this complaint, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\\n\\nMost Respectfully, XXXX XXXX XXXX\",\n",

My Account Number is : XXXX In the State of Maryland, when you have a new build or new construction home in a development that has never had any water/sewage or other pipes, the county for which you live in charges the payment for laying those pipes to you the homeowner. The Homeowner is responsible for this bill on an annual basis and it is serviced out of different companies. It is typically called a Front Foot-Impound but the billing company who collects the money on behalf of the State will name it whatever they want. This is an annual bill that must be paid for whatever the County and/or Sate approximates it out to be. Usually it is about 20 years at a fixed rate. If you do not pay this fee, you will receive a lien on your property for not paying it. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX my husband and I closed on our home and had this Front Foot-Impound Fee written into our Escrow by our lawyers and our original lender Prosperity Mortgages. Prosperity then sold our mortgage to Caliber Home Loans. Caliber accepted our mortgage as it stood with Prosperity, which included accepting that this Front Foot-Impound fee was built into our escrow and that it should pay out of our Escrow. Our house is not a total new build for us, but it is XXXX years old, so we still owe 13 more years on the Front Foot-Impound Fee as the new owners ( again - we have it built in to pay from our Escrow - see attached documents ). On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, we received our first Front Foot-Impound Fee from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX titled the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( again the State of Maryland allows 3rd party companies to collect the fees on their behalf and they title them however they are titled - not something we can control ). I took the bill to our HOA president to confirmed that this was the Front Foot-Impound Fee for our community and however I needed to pay it, it needed to be paid or I would receive a lien. Again - I have it to come out of Escrow. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I contacted Caliber, explained the bill to the Tax Department and sent in the documents including a copy of my Escrow Account Breakdown stating that it should pay out of my Escrow. Caliber \\'s Tax Department stated that they would pay out the bill by XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Please note this bill is due XXXX/XXXX/XXXX or else, you have a lien on our property. If received after XXXX/XXXX/XXXX it will be {$490.00} and anything later causes a lien. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I decided on my own to call Caliber and double check on the status of the bill. I spoke w/ Sequioa in the Tax Department who indicated that Caliber decided that they were not going to pay the bill because they thought it was a water utility bill. I asked why when Caliber decided to not pay the bill : why did I not get an email, text message, formal letter, phone call, smoke signal, or courier pigeon to inform me of such. We are one week from the due date and no correspondence was received from Caliber in regard to their decision and lack of action. I spoke with a manager ( XXXX ) after XXXX put me on hold for 10 minutes due to \" phone issues \\'\\'. Again I was advised that they did n\\'t believe it was the Front Foot-Impound Fee because it did n\\'t directly say that. I was also advised by XXXX that Caliber never intended to pay for this bill because they did n\\'t budget for it. But again, this was in the loan documents they agreed to when they took over the loan.Not once did Caliber call the company to double check what I was sending them. Caliber tried to inform me that Caliber did n\\'t have to pay the fee although Caliber accepted the loan from Prosperity as is, thus they are violating the contract Caliber accepted the loan under.

       " \"My family has owned our home in XXXX XXXX New York for 24 years and are facing foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX because of the roadblocks that our mortgage lender Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing has put in our way. My name is XXXX XXXX and I am the heir and rightful owner of this home. W refinanced the home in XX/XX/XXXX to take care of some needed repairs and were convinced it would be in our best interests to only put my mother XXXX XXXX on the loan. After she passed away in XX/XX/XXXX we ran into some financial difficulties and fell behind about a year later. When we tried to contact the lender at the time, XXXX XXXX XXXX, they told us they could not negotiate because my name was not on the loan. We then took the legal steps to get the paperwork in order with the estate and went back to XXXX XXXX XXXX, who approved us for a loan modification. We made our trial payments as agreed for several months, and were told that permanent modification paperwork was coming. This never happened, and we have been in limbo ever since. The loan was transferred to Shellpoint about 18 months ago and it appears this was done with the intent to foreclose. Despite multiple attempts to engage or get them to consider us for homeowner assistance programs, they have stopped us at every turn. We do not have an assigned contact, they have never actually reviewed our current financial information and they have not followed procedures and guidelines relating to notifications and recordings of their intent to auction the home. This has always been an avoidable foreclosure, but Shellpoint seems to have no interest in working with us and I need to file a formal complaint against them.\\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX I began having health issues and was reduced to part time and began receiving XXXX payments. We were able to keep up with the payments despite my reduction in hours. My mother passed in XX/XX/XXXX and this put us into a tougher financial situation, although there was a small inheritance that we were able to use to keep up with the bills until XX/XX/XXXX. I was still having health issues and only working part time in XX/XX/XXXX when we first defaulted on the loan while it was with XXXX XXXX XXXX. Shortly after falling behind we began contacting XXXX XXXX XXXX   to try and get them to review us for a loan modification, but they told us that since the loan was in my mother 's name they could not work with me. We then took the legal steps to get the situation remedied and were finally able to get XXXX XXXX XXXX to offer us a trial loan modification. We made all payments as agreed, but never received the permanent modification paperwork. We made repeated calls to XXXX XXXX XXXX, but they reverted to the stance that they could not work with us because I was not on the original loan. No matter how many times I sent in the legal documents demonstrating the fact that I was the rightful owner, they continued to deny me. The loan was then transferred to XXXX, and we went through the same situation, and it has been more of the same with Shellpoint.\\n\\nWe had a change in our financial situation a few years ago -- my health has improved and I am working full time and my husband works full time as well and receives a pension on top of that. We have the means to afford a reasonable payment -- this foreclosure could be avoided, if only Shellpoint would DO THEIR JOB! I have gotten lawyers involved who can't believe the way we have been treated and ignored and how this issue of a few months of missed payments has now turned into a foreclosure sale.\",\n",

On XX/XX/XXXX it came back as a fraudulent check the funds for it were reversed. On this day I was on my second day of a four days in bed. I talked to one gentleman at the bank. He explained what happened and said he couldnt help because I used the funds I stated around XXXX XXXX dollars he agreed we hung up. Hours later after waking up from a medication dose I had more questions so I called back. At that time a woman informed me of three separate transactions all from the same XXXX store two towns away. They were for {$1000.00}, {$900.00}, {$78.00}. I informed the woman I only do my shopping online and very rarely leave my house and had actually made an online purchase to XXXX that morning using my XXXX account. But I did admit to recognizing charges to a dollar store and XX/XX/XXXX and told her I had my daughter go get me some things. She closed my card and sent me something to fill out. XX/XX/XXXX I sent the form stating a dispute for the charges at some point a {$1900.00} credit was put on my account on XX/XX/XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from a woman using a very off putting tone stating my dispute has been denied and the money would be reversed on XX/XX/XXXX. 7 days later even though the funds were available within the next day. They froze the account for 7 days. This woman told me my PIN number was used for these transactions I disagreed and explained I havent used a pin at a store for 23 years because of extra charges that used to occur she stated its impossible to not use a pin for the card. She insisted about my PIN number 3 times then stated I used it at an atm recently so it must be true. She then scolded me for letting my daughter use my card to my bank even though it is my money. I also read all their policies I could find and it is not stated that that is not allowed. She then blamed me for having the money in my account and told me if it wasnt in there the charges would not of went through. At this point I hung up and consulted my husband. We always thought money was supposed to be in your bank account and have never been blamed before for having any in our accounts. Plus I feel its obvious it is a military account that the military puts money in for my husbands service and anyone can put a card on a machine hope it works then take another chance and so on. We then started going back and forth with the bank with a different solution and story from approximately 25 people through my now on 19 days journey. But we didnt know the account was frozen I was just told the money would be removed on XX/XX/XXXX. After a doctors appointment we tried to use my husbands card on XX/XX/XXXX and it had been declined with his deposit and my support deposit in it. We called the woman said it was frozen but the money should have come out because it was available she then later stated the XXXX. I then called and requested a letter from the denial I received one in the mail it was dated on XX/XX/XXXX and it also verified fund removal would be on the XXXX also that all pre scheduled payments would be honored for 5 days after the date of the letter. They werent they were all sent back and I am now responsible for extra fees. On XX/XX/XXXX a secure message was sent stating as soon as our account reached {$2800.00} that amount would be removed because of the bad check. It was already removed. So once again given wrong information. On XX/XX/XXXX the money disappeared from my account balance with no record of where it went. I also had been on the phone everyday with a representative no questions ever got answered. XX/XX/XXXX finally arrived at XXXX at night I received a message that my account was open and in the positive status. At XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I called to verify the woman looked said it was fine even called the back office for a second verification. I tried to use the account had issues called back at XXXX again assured everything was working. Another call went to them at XXXX once again told everything looked good I proceeded to catch up the bills that had been returned. My husband went to a pet store and a dollar store and I think XX/XX/XXXX. Everything was fine. Later he ran somewhere and the card was declined we looked up the account and the {$1900.00} had been taken out in the middle of the day. Yes I called. A not nice woman looked into it then went on to tell me oh well it came out a day late I should of known better. This is after 4 verifications from representatives of the bank. I once again had to sit there and be scolded and told its all my fault. Again all bills I paid were returned and over {$300.00} charges have been charged to me. Even after one woman I talked to that said everything was fine had noticed a returned check fee on my account and reversed it on XX/XX/XXXX saying it was a mistake. Ive recieved three different stories of how to file an appeal a couple days after a woman telling me to secure message them I received an answer stating that they see that theyve told me how to do it already. After a phone call that lasted for 2 hours and 14 minutes I was told to call between 8-5 the next day to speak with security and this was relayed to me from the security office. The next day I called back that phone call lasted 3 hours and 31 minutes and included 2 people calling the security office 3 times between the both of them. I was then relayed the message I will not be allowed to have a debit card to access my money for 6 months. Still no help. It has now been 19 days our second direct deposits will be dropping in the morning but once again the money will be eaten away. As being two cycles of pay which our bills separate and come out at each pay and now will be returned again and more fees will happen my husbands command will more than likely be notified along with this hit being taken into consideration for his security clearance which his job depends on. Today is 2 weeks since I requested a copy of the denial letter I got an email from member services with an attached copy of it this afternoon. In my long journey I have done a fair amount of research on this credit union. I have found such bad reviews and sadly one of them is almost my exact story and pieces and parts of the other ones also share my experience. I understand there are millions of customers at these credit unions Im also wondering how many people this is happening to that this takes so long to get a reaction to. My denial and debit card being revoked decisions where made in approximately 2 days. This is peoples lifes and careers and credit they are messing with and dragging their feet with. Also in their policy one of the first sentences is that they are constantly monitoring for unusual transactions on your account. Im confused on how 3 separate transactions in one place for more money than Ive ever  spent other than on a car that I had to call the bank and get permission to do first doesnt flag anything especially since I have alerts for purchases around {$200.00} in one day in one purchase that they have flagged.

I expect that at list 140,000 will sign this petition and I expect to have even 200,000 people defrauded by them that will sign it. Strange all people respecting the law are defrauded by criminals protected by strange laws that must be challenge now. I will do this from now on even if will take me 50 years I am ready now. I no longer tolerate those cover-ups abuses and see my property being destroyed by criminals looters in this top secret close door act even if they got help from Public Offices establish to protect people and keep order in this Country. After our very long today conversation about the criminal activity of Law Firm Phelan Hallinan, XXXX inside my property I will confirm that XXXX, Phelan Hallinan, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX beside lying those company are doing only their best to manipulate the truth and this I will never tolerate. During the conversation you stated that CFPB needs a few thousand complains so criminal organizations like XXXX, Phelan Hallinan, XXXX and XXXX will be penalized like minim like XXXX XXXX ( {$1.00} bill ). In your site is stated that over 13,520 complaining about them was not enough to bring them a {$2.00} bill penalty. As mention during our phone conversation I have as of now a petition signed by 69,466 people and I expect to get at list 150,000 to 200,000 people signing this petition before I go public. They provide me a one page letter describing what happened and gave me a mortgage invoice so criminal organization ca no longer lie. You stated that they should file their claims directly so I will make sure that this will happened in the next weeks. I will also instruct them how to contact you directly. A full copy of the 69466 petition I will bring to DOJ, Dept. of Commerce Federal Reserve SEC, PA Banking Department, Attorney General of PA and USA and your Institution in Washington DC. I am a person determined to protect my property legally not criminal like those looters that vandalize, and destroyed it intetionaly. I will never stop until I get back my property for which I do not have any mortgage or financial obligation. A property foreclosed illegal and criminal in a top secret close door by XXXX XXXX XXXX and looted by this Law Firm Phelan Hallinan only because my name is on the DEED. They also had the impertinence to mention that even if I do not have any mortgage or financial obligation under the Mortgage Note I was looted because of my name on the DEED and put this in writing for which I thank them since they will not understand the legal implication. What those looter confused is the economic concept of private property which refers to the rights owners have to the exclusive use and disposal of a physical object. Property is not a table, a chair, or an acre of land. It is the bundle of rights which the owner is entitled to employ those objects. The alternative ( collectivist ) view is that private property consists merely of a legal deed to an object with the use and disposal of the object subject to the whims and mercies of the state. Well is very clear that today in Pennsylvania is a crime to be the owner of a property. In case your name is on the DEED a criminal Law Firm like Phelan Hallinan or XXXX will find an opportunity to loot your property in a top secret close door act since the laws in PA protects those criminals and you as a person are guilty for having your name on the DEED. Their Constitution and Bill of Rights protected property in many ways The Founders were worried that Congress might use the tax system to loot property owners in some states for the advantage of other states. Accordingly, they required that direct taxes ( mostly importantly property and income taxes ) be apportioned among the states ( Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 and Article I, Section 9, Clause 4 ). They also required that indirect taxes, such as import duties, be levied uniformly ( I-8-1 and I-9-6 ). When it became clear that the ban on ex post facto laws was not broad enough to protect property, they partially plugged the gap with the Fifth Amendment, which ( 1 ) prevented any person from being be deprived of his property, without due process of laws and ( 2 ) required compensation when a property [ was ] taken for public use. They added a section ( Article I, Section 10 ) with several provisions protecting financial assets against state governments. They granted the federal courts jurisdiction over interstate land claims and interstate debts to limit the extent to which state courts could discriminate against the property rights of out-of-staters ( III-2-1 and III-2-2 ). They added the Eighth Amendment, which barred excessive fines. With the letter of this lair representing Law Firm Phelan Hallinan I will challenge even the above mention ownership law protected under the Constitution since is a liability to own a property in PA that can be looted, vandalize, destroyed by criminals only because your name is on PA Deed. Even if you do not have any financial obligation under a Mortgage Note your guilt is your name on the DEED only a looter specialist from Phelan Hallinan can invent this garbage. For this letter I will say Thank you to this looting expert Law Firm Phelan Hallinan since I will use it in order to challenge the ownership law of our country. I will explain below how. I am a victim of the most criminal and fraudulent foreclosure done intentionally in a top secret close door act against PA Foreclosure XX/XX/XXXX done in XX/XX/XXXX ( not  XX/XX/XXXX when looting started ) by an unscrupulous and deceiving lawyer representing Udren Law firm a company that I expect to disappear soon. I am defending my property using only Legal system not like this XXXX, XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX Law Firm or Law FirmXX/XX/XXXXPhelan Hallinan that used looter XXXX of XXXX XXXX to vandalize, abuse and destroyed my property for which I do not have any mortgage or financial obligation. In XX/XX/XXXX Law Firm Phelan Hallinan used looter XXXX and her {$75000.00} ( wow!!! Business ), XXXX XXXX organized the massive theft, vandalism, destruction when they empty my private property for which I do not have any mortgage as well as no financial obligation only because my name is on the DEED. I have no financial obligation under any Mortgage Note in this planet. The excuse to say that everything looted was also dispose because they could not contact me this is a clear case of primitive case of cover up that I will deal with it in Criminal Court once I get back my property. If looter XXXX do not put back all my properties we will meet me in Criminal Court soon and the amount will not be {$260000.00} but {$10.00} mill.',\n",

Those XXXX close credit inquiries lowered XXXX of my XXXX A+ credit points to B. \\nDisservice # 2I was told a drive-by appraisal would suffice.

XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX were satisfied with the second picture, and XXXX told me settlement should occur within a few days. XXXX sent me an information packet I would need for settlement.

He refused to acknowledge the satisfying second picture, and set the condition for a full walk through appraisal.

On page 2, the 3rd bold section under Additional Trial Payment Plan Information and Legal Notices state, Your current loan documents remain in effect ; however, you may make the Trial Payment Period Payment instead of the payment required under your loan documents. ( I also have monthly statements from XX/XX/2017 showing the dates these payments were received. ) Despite the acceptance and fulfillment of this TPP, and despite reassurance from 3 different LoanCare representatives each month that I personally made the TPP payments by phone, I have incurred 60+ and 90+ late payment marks on my credit report with LoanCare.

Both representatives agreed that their respective materials needed to better explain the process for this type of transaction. They indicated that they would be forwarding this information up their respective chains of command. \\n\\nBy the next day, the XXXX site again showed the payment, and the XXXX site again showed a debit of {$7400.00} from my cash account.

I mention very clear that first we must solve the abuses done by XXXX and then we can discuss the Modification or HARP. Otherwise through your action you are asking me to accept all abuses and massive overcharges and this will never be done.

The account was purchase on XX/XX/XXXX. In one invoice the monthly payment is {$6000.00} and in another is {$3300.00}!!! It is clear that there is a luck of communication in your Institution as is not possible to have too many incorrect invoices reflecting only abuses nut real amount. It is very clear that with each new letters received from you all facts are more confusing than necessary. Your our institution explain the situation point by point in the XX/XX/XXXX letter but this was only a theoretical presentation, that do not solve the abuse and fraud done by XXXX. Please no longer use such letter as a response since this is NOT THE CASE. I made it very clear that XXXX/XXXX  XXXX XXXX defrauded my family as well as your bank. Your Bank ignored completely all my correspondence, WHY?? I prefer to have a face to face meeting with you and present you documents and you will see how this XXXX defraud people. How your Institution is helping me when in your last invoice for example the interest is {$30000.00} and this is very much overstated. The abuse is very clear since XXXX tried to overcharge me in one year a total amount for taxes and Insurance equivalent to 12 year. So for the rest of the mortgage your bank wants now to charge me a total of 269 years of taxes and insurance!!! Translate in dollars your Institution now if I make the payment will charge me the equivalent of 400 % the entire cost of the Mortgage Note and this is like paying for 4 houses at the same time. This is exact what your Institution inherited from XXXX and tried to overcharge me NOW. WHY?? You address this issue in your XX/XX/XXXXletter????? / This is abuse and fraud not theory mention in your letter. It is very clear now that either your Department did not read any of my correspondence or simply ignore them. This is abuse and fraud not theory as mention in your letter. Each week I receive letters from you that present each time more confusing facts and clear indication that your Institution does not want to solve the dispute even if I comply with your request to answer within 30 days period of any dispute when you sent me the first massive overstated invoice. I received the invoice and it is very clear that all my correspondence sent by me are ignored constantly. Interest claimed by you in your last invoice is {$340000.00}!!!

I WILL EXPLAIN AGAIN BELOW SO YOU CAN UNDERST HOW CONFUISING IS YOUR LETTER THAT clearly indicate the creative accounting preform by XXXX in order to defraud my family. The only way you can understand the situation is clearly having an open conversation and not only can we prove 100 % that our information are accurate but you will understand how XXXX defraud families of their properties and this must STOP A.S.A.P. In order for you to understand the massive abuses done to my family INTENTOIONALY by XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX   that not only defrauded my family but your bank too please read carefully this letter. In my XX/XX/XXXX letter I stated very clear the abuses done by XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX  that LIE in ever doc. sent to your Bank. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from your bank confirming that XXXX transferred my mortgage XXXX : XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX to your institution. Your Bank asked me to confirm the outstanding amount of {>= $1,000,000}. THIS IS FALSE. Also in that letter you Bank stated that the amount due was {$560000.00} ( THIS IS FALSE AGAIN ) from which {$320000.00} ( includingXX/XX/XXXX represents interests unpaid for 63 months or 5 years and 3 months ) as well as an Escrow amount of {$100000.00} all-inclusive up to date of XX/XX/XXXX ( also 63 months or 5 years and 3 months )!!!. The Escrow account statement in my possession show a large surplus but in your doc it show only a surplus of {$3000.00}!!!!! How can you have a surplus if the account was not paid for 63 months??? In XX/XX/XXXX I tried to make payments and the Special Department of XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX   call me 4 times telling me that I was not allowing to make any payment until the account situation would clear ( Was in a selling process since XX/XX/XXXX!!!! ) As requested by your Institution I confirmed my DISPUT within 30 days from XX/XX/XXXX. I also got a letter from XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX,  confirming the fact that for 63 months includingXX/XX/XXXX, the balance is {$430000.00} ( see attached XXXX Doc ) instead of {$560000.00} as claimed be Ocwen bank. Only from those outstanding balances I TOTALLY DESAGREE with the amounts. Your bank OVERSTASTED the amount documented by XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX by {$120000.00} XXXX 30 % ). Also XXXX/ XXXX XXXX Bank tries desperate to inflate the amount by {$150000.00} or an extra 35 % from the real outstanding balance that also includes fraud charges of {$24000.00} paid at the closing to get a fix rate and so on!!!! This means that Ocwen Bank inflates the outstanding balance by {$250000.00}!!! ( 46 % extra ) WHY??? FACTS : According with XXXX /XXXX XXXX XXXX  the interest balance is {$320000.00}. This means that I did not pay for 94 months, not 63 as is officially mention in both letters from XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX as well as your bank. Since the monthly interest payment mention in your documents is {$3400.00} multiply with 63 equal {$210000.00} Your bank tries to charge me an additional 48 % ( OVERCHAGE ) of {$100000.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX the rate was only 3 % ( I have proof ), but your documents show a rate of 3.375 % increase by 0.375 % or an extra charge per month of {$380.00}. So, from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX there are 50 months multiply with {$380.00} equal an OVERCHARGE ( EXTRA ) of $ XXXX.We also paid at the closing an amount of US XXXX for a discount rate of 5 % nothing else. XXXX intentionally change the rate by 0.875 % which increases the monthly payment by over $ XXXX.so for 38 months an overcharge of {$34000.00} 1 ) It is clear that XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX use a CREATIV ACCOUNT Done by one of their painters not accountants so they can create a false impression of the unpaid balance.\\n\\n2 ) On the Escrow account is mention an outstanding balance of {$100000.00} including XX/XX/XXXX. In the Escrow account is included amounts paid for taxes and for insurance. Since my taxes per year are around {$10000.00} and the Insurance is only {$1400.00} the total per year is only {$12000.00} and for 63 months the total amount is XXXX = {$1000.00} per month multiply with 63 months equal {$63000.00}. According with your calculation and XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  the outstanding balance is {$100000.00} or 103 months of unpaid escrow. So your bank and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX calculate an extra profit of 64 % or OVERCHARGE of {$40000.00}. You make your own conclusions.\\n\\n3 ) Also in your statement is mention an overpaid amount of {$3000.00} in the escrow account!! All this for 63 months!!! How can you have an OVERPAYMENT in the ESCROW account OF {$3000.00} unless there is a creative accounting done intentionally by a bank that defrauded my family starting with the day when the closing took place? \\n4 ) All information provided to you by XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX are FALSE as this bank sold an account purchased from FDIC for only 8 % ( I can give you concrete information ). XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX   made a profit in one year of 900 % of the face value. Not to mention that they seriously overcharge your bank when they sold in such a rush their account thinking that they are out of any liability. They are totally wrong. Adding all those amounts that OVERSTATE THE outstanding balance ( see above explanation ) we have the following : $ {$250000.00} plus {$100000.00} in interest plus {$19000.00} in interest plus {$34000.00} in interest and {$40000.00} in escrow we have an OVERCHARGE of {$450000.00}. All explanation prepared by a former bank Controller. \\nI kindly ask you again for support in order to solve the dispute as we are determined not to absorb the abuse of XXXX. If your institution is interested in solving this issue I am sure we can find a solution. I prefer to settle the account so we can close it. Other issues that needs clarification please see : 1 ) The closing was done over my house and the agent came at XXXX driving 30 miles. Since was a big storm coming the closer rush us in order to avoid the storm. \\n2 ) The mortgage Note implanted on the date of closing include facts never discuss with me like the rate of 5.875 % fixed for 4 years and also interest only!!!! According with this doc in XX/XX/XXXX the rate will be adjustable ( interest only ) until XX/XX/XXXX!!!!! In XX/XX/XXXX the rate was 3 % only but your doc show a rate of 3.375 % increase by 0.375 % or an extra charge per month of {$380.00}!!! So from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX there are 50 months multiply with {$380.00} equal an OVERCHARGE of {$19000.00}!!! \\n3 ) We also paid at the closing an amount of US XXXX for a discount fix rate of 5 %. The difference in rate of 0.875 % increases the monthly payment by over {$900.00}. 38 moths overcharge of {$34000.00}!!! \\n4 ) These conditions were never discussed with me during the negotiation process.\\n\\n5 ) Since XX/XX/XXXX XXXX refused to investigate and help me clear the abuses done by them for so long. \\n6 ) My husband was told that the mortgage pay is interest only for 2 years, a day later was for 5 years and finally another day later for 10 years with prepay penalty for 3 yr. or 5 yr. Whats the situation? \\nI prefer to settle this account and close this chapter since the abuses of XXXX XXXX XXXX is going to drag your bank and tarnish your reputation too in the Court system',\n",

In particular, the Single Point of Contact ( SPOC ) statute sets the standard for customer service in the loss mitigation arena that should be used as the benchmark through the country. This is even truer because case law interpreting the Homeowner Bill of Rights is tipping in the borrowers favor. Given the current environment, loan servicers, whether in California or not, would be best served by taking a conservative approach to pinning down issues of SPOC compliance. \\nIn its basic form, the SPOC rules, codified under Civil Code 2923.7, mandate that servicers promptly assign a SPOC to the borrowers and explore alternatives to foreclosure with them, if requested. This seems like a mutually beneficial arrangement because borrowers want to exhaust all options to keep their homes, and servicers wish to have the loan performing again. However, it is often a challenge for both parties because of timelines and documentation requirements. \\nThe legislature enacted section 2923.7 to ensure more transparency in the loss mitigation process and to ensure all loss mitigation efforts were explored before a foreclosure occurred. The legislature also sought to address a common homeowner complaint about being handed off to multiple asset managers, who did not know the loan, which caused the homeowners to duplicate their efforts. At the same time, those borrowers felt there was the threat of a foreclosure looming and no assurance that the servicer would be able to stop the foreclosure while the borrower attempted to submit the required documentation. \\nWhen is a SPOC Necessary?\\n\\nSection 2923.7 ( a ) states : Upon request from a borrower who requests a foreclosure prevention alternative, the mortgage servicer shall promptly establish a single point of contact and provide to the borrower one or more direct means of communication with the single point of contact. \\nDifferent courts have different views on when this section becomes operable. One court stated that a lender need only assign a SPOC when a borrower requests one be assigned. XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX US Dist XXXX XXXX. Another court came to the opposite conclusion and held that the SPOC must be assigned if the borrower seeks a foreclosure prevention alternative. XXXX v. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX., XXXX. ( XXXX, XXXX XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX US Dist XXXX XXXX. \\nThough there are two opinions, the best option to remain compliant is to assign the SPOC when a borrower requests an alternative to foreclosure. That position is consistent with the plain reading of the statute and would be consistent with the purpose of the statute to offer options to the borrower about which he or she may not know. \\nWhat is the SPOC Required to Do? \\nThe statute enumerates the SPOCs responsibilities. The SPOC must be able to : Communicate the loan assistance application process and explain the timelines under which both parties will operate ; Coordinate the receipt of all necessary documents and notify the borrower of any required documents necessary to complete the application ; Access the borrowers status with regard to the foreclosure prevention alternative ; Ensure the borrower is considered for all foreclosure prevention alternatives offered by the servicer ; and Communicate with those who have the authority to stop foreclosure proceedings. Civil Code 2923.7 ( b ). \\nThe fundamental purpose of the SPOC is to be an entry point to the servicers loss mitigation network, which often contains a distressed asset component, a foreclosure component, and an underwriting component. The SPOC is meant to be the one person that can lead the borrower through this network and ensure the borrower is considered for all options for relief. \\nIn addition to the foregoing, the legislature has required a higher level of supervisory oversight. The statute expressly states that the SPOC must refer the borrower to his or her supervisor, if any, upon request. In other words, the SPOC may not be the last point of contact.',\n",

My realtor used the software from XXXX right after we listed it to get it approved for a short sale. Well, the sheriff sale is tomorrow so obviously, the approval NEVER came. \\nMy realtor put the sign in the yard in XXXX to get the process started. When we contacted NationStar, they told us that we needed to start the process on the XXXX site to get the property approved for the Short Sale. During this time, we received an offer that we had to wait to submit because of this whole process. When my realtor listed my property and if there were any delays to submit these documents, we were waiting for a response from NationStar representative. When my realtor talked to someone else at the company, because after more than a week, she still had no response from him. She was told he had been away on vacation and no one had taken over his files when he was gone. Every other document that we were told we needed was submitted within about 2 days time. Also, when these were needed, my agent would notify me when she needed them. After I would send them to her, she would again notify me when she would upload them to XXXX. NationStar was telling me when I called that the realtor was causing the delay with failure to upload documents and I knew this to not be the case, as she and I were in constant contact. \\nMultiple times, we would contact NationStar within minutes of each other and every time we talked to a representative, we were told different things EVERY time we called. When I received the final papers that the house was going up for sheriff sale on XXXX XXXX, to say the least, I was shocked. We have been working on this diligently to expedite the Short Sale review so we could get approved to submit the offer of over {$70000.00}. \\nIn multiple phone calls from either myself or my realtor, they would tell us there were documents that needed to be submitted that had already been submitted to XXXX ( weeks prior. ) When they asked for these, I told them what date they were sent and then they would find them in the system. \\nThe times my agent would inquire into what documents were needed, she would receive a generic message from the rep, stating that ALL the required documents needed to be submitted again. Typically, it was updating of a bank statement or pay stub. When we would call NationStar Short Sale department, they say it was the XXXX or new bank statements, which had already been submitted. \\nAfter multiple go-rounds with NationStar for almost a year, again where they are telling my realtor one thing and myself a completely different thing, my house is now going up for sheriff sale. The XXXX week of XXXX, we were told to submit MORE documents, documents that had already been sent in.

Since there was no explanation for the absence of the private loan and the appearance of this significantly higher federal loan, we began calling to find out what was going on. After a couple months of asking if it was still private or federal ( because if Private, why did the rate jump beyond the \" interest only \\'\\' amount and if Federal, why is it not set to {$0.00} for the IBR ), in XX/XX/XXXX a representative admitted that this was a private loan, even though they moved it under the heading of Federal, and even though it was private, it had been taken out of the \" interest only \\'\\' plan it was under previously. At this point they had played a shell-game over the location and type of loan, obstructed my inquiries, and removed it from any repayment plan without notifying me, multiplying the payments beyond what my husband and I could afford. \\nIt took until XX/XX/XXXX for a loan manager to give any explanation to us about what happened A YEAR EARLIER. By this time, even if Navient was willing to work with us, the amount had grown out of control, and they were STILL unwilling to help us, even though it all started with their action. They claimed to have options, but none of them could fit our tight budget, nor were they close to the prior \" interest only \\'\\' plan. \\nMy husband and I tried to keep lines of communication open, but found no assistance on their end.

One month we might talk with a very helpful person who tries to explain the situation to us and find resolution. However, the next person we speak with might be rude, unhelpful, and tell us different information than the previous person, making it impossible to get a clear story from them about what needs to happen with the loan. It is also very convenient that when we ask questions about the previous call, the notes typed into the record by the previous representative seem to miss any of the information we recall that would be helpful or pertinent to a resolution. \\nThe collections calls started in XX/XX/XXXX to my husband and parents ( my parents being co-signers XXXX.

On the morning of XXXX/XXXX/16, I awoke to discover via email that the case had been decided in favor of the buyer, the case was closed, and {$740.00} had been debited from my PayPal account. PayPal did not tell me why they had ruled in the buyer \\'s favor. They did not provide me with proof that the items I shipped were \" not as described \\'\\' as claimed. They also did not provide me with proof that the buyer was unable to eventually enter the festival with the wristbands I provided. I contacted PayPal via phone on XXXX/XXXX/16 and spoke with a dispute supervisor. He reviewed the case and said PayPal could not overturn their decision. He did not tell me why. I called eBay on XXXX/XXXX/16 and spoke with someone who identified himself as a supervisor. He said since the buyer had filed the claim through PayPal, there was nothing eBay could do to refund my money. Now, I have neither the wristbands nor the money. It \\'s a perfect scam : The buyer went to a four-day music festival for free. PayPal and eBay have absolutely no protection for sellers, despite their claims otherwise.',\n",

How it works is XXXX. XXXX reduces your credit limit ( normally down to your current balance ). The cause and affect is the XXXX main credit repositories now lower your score due to higher credit utilization. The credit repositories like to see credit utilization of 40 % or less.

       " \"Bank of America continues to engage in deceptive, unfair and abusive behavior in the management of an XXXX linked mastercard. Specifically, across a month or so, it has repeatedly denied me access to the account, online or by phone, most of the time after assuring me that this would not be the case, that the card was workable and that I could see activity through online banking. Yet, after lying repeatedly, it continued to decline multiple charges for little reason, several after claiming that the card was functioning. This is an habitual and typical abuse for this card and I have filed previous CFPB complaints about it, with little change. \\n\\nThis XXXX associated credit card, one might think, is associated with travel. However, when I travel, the chances of the card being denied increases considerably and this happened recently. Traveling with the card frequently renders it unusable. \\n\\nBank of America engages in bad faith behavior by this and at least two other characteristic activities. First, it tries to elude being reached by telephone. The phone number on the back of this card is miniscule and uses white typeface against a light colored, light grey, card. It is simply illegible. When I finally was able to get a magnifying glass to read the number BOA does not want its credit card customers to use because it does not want to pay for employees to handle the calls, I encountered long wait times on the telephone, a second means of eluding public contact. Next, on one of many calls to it, a BOA representative told me I had to answer so-called security questions for her to make the card work as advertised again. BOA frequently uses garbage for security purposes, asks questions that are based on false information, then denies me access to the account, online or to use, because I do not answer with the false information that BOA wants and has embraced at the core of its operations. This is but one of many habitual problems with BOA 's operations for this card. \\n\\nWhen I called perhaps for the third time to get the hold BOA put on this card and refused to release for false and abusive reasons, I was told at some point that it had to issue a new card and that it would send a new one overnight to me. Yet, as it always does, BOA lied again. The card did not arrive overnight but two days later, a real problem when I travel. After getting the new card a day late, I activated it by phone and was told that it would work. Wrong again. BOA, lied about that as well. The first time I tried to use the card after the activation, the charge was denied again. I called the elusive representatives again, and was again assured that the card would work. Yet, this claim also was a lie, as the new card has not worked as advertised since I received it, despite me being told that it would 2 or more times, days apart, by 2 or more sources. Clearly, BOA has a systemic problem that it simply lies about to placate customers too busy to call it and hang on the phone until someone answers the call with another lie. \\n\\nI have resorted to using another credit card and doubt I will try to use the card that so many representatives of BOA are trained to lie about on cue. \\n\\nWhy do the CFPB and XXXX allow BOA to lie habitually to customers who try to use the XXXX mastercard?\",\n",

This does not meet the Federal Trade Commissions guidelines of what constitutes proper debt validation In addition, in the case of XXXX Vs. XXXX ( IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA, No. XXXX ), the court ruled that : 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ( emphasis added ). On XX/XX/XXXX, nineteen days after the date of XXXX debt collection letter, XXXX counsel XXXX sent XXXX a letter declaring that XXXX disputes your debt collection-related allegations, denies the same, and demands strict proof and verification thereof. Record at 21. As such, XXXX should have ceased his debt collection efforts immediately upon receiving that letter. Instead, XXXX proceeded to obtain a default judgment against XXXX on the debt collection claim before he had mailed XXXX the necessary verification and, thus, violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). \\n\\nXXXX maintains, however, that there was no violation of the FDCPA because he sent adequate verification of the debt [ to XXXX ] in the XX/XX/XXXX notice of claim. Brief of XXXX at 13. Specifically, XXXX claims that a copy of the consumer credit contract between XXXX and XXXX XXXX attached to the notice of claim provided sufficient verification of the debt within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). We can not agree. \\n\\nThe contract in no way provides sufficient verification of the debt. A review of the document reveals that it identifies only the terms of XXXX loan, including a 17.99 % annual interest rate and the original loan amount of {$2500.00}. The loan agreement contains no accounting of any payments made by XXXX, the dates on which those payments were made, the interest which had accrued, or any late fees which had been assessed once XXXX stopped making the required payments. Indeed, the existing unpaid contract balance at the time XXXX sent the debt collection notice was at least {$350.00} more than the original loan amount. Therefore, XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) when he failed to cease collection of the debt by obtaining a default judgment against XXXX after XXXX had notified XXXX in writing that he was disputing the debt but before XXXX had mailed verification of the debt to XXXX. We reverse the trial courts entry of summary judgment in favor of XXXX on this issue. \\n\\nI notice that you are still reporting this collection on my credit report, which is considered to be a collection activity. You are now in violation of the FCPDA, and are now subject to fines of {$1000.00}, plus actual damages and attorneys fees, which I may collect from you by filing a claim in small claims court. These collections on my credit report are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ XXXX. \\n\\nYou should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information to major credit bureaus might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} fine, plus punitive damages. I'm sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request could put your company in serious legal trouble with the FTC and other state or federal agencies. \\n\\nI intend to follow through with the suit if I do not hear back from you within 15 days. \\n\\n\\nI look forward to hearing from you, XXXX XXXX\",\n",

Accordingly, my escrow service ( Ditech Financial LLC ) paid the amount of {$10000.00} to the District of Columbia within the appropriate time-frame. The payment was posted on XX/XX/XXXX. I subsequently contacted the District of Columbia and submitted the appropriate paperwork to prove that my property was in fact occupied ( and not vacant ) and the District of Columbia issued a corrected property tax bill in XX/XX/XXXX reflecting what the charge should have been for the second half of XX/XX/XXXX : {$1800.00}, and also acknowledging the amount of over-payment : {$8800.00}. After receiving this corrected bill and acknowledgement in XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted the District again to ask how I can get refunded for the over-payment. The District told me to have my escrow service request the refund from them since the escrow had made the actual payment. So in XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Ditech Financial to request the refund. They told me that they do these types of requests all the time and that they work with the District frequently and were very familiar with refund process. Ditech told me they would request the refund from the District and the refund would probably take several weeks to process. XX/XX/XXXX rolls around and I receive my Escrow Analysis for the XX/XX/XXXX tax year from Ditech and they tell me that because of the $ XXXX  payment in XX/XX/XXXX, my escrow was in arrears and my new monthly payment as of XX/XX/XXXX would go up about {$800.00}. I called them that a refund should have been requested and processed by now in order to avoid the massive increase in my monthly payment. Ditech claimed they requested the refund from the District but still had not heard back and that the District was likely still processing it. I did not trust this response and contacted the District myself and was told that Ditech never requested a refund at all. The District checked all the way back to XX/XX/XXXX and did not see any request from Ditech regarding my property. So on XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Ditech and told them that they never made a refund request to the District. Ditech told me they had faxed the request in XX/XX/XXXX and numerous times after that. I called back the District and they said that they don\\'t process fax requests and that all refund requests must be submitted via email at : XXXX. I called back Ditech and gave them this email and told them that they should have emailed the request instead of faxing it. Ditech claimed that they have a working relationship with the District and always fax their requests. Ditech also refused to contact the District themselves to verify that I was correct or to even directly speak with them to see what had happened, even after I had begged them to help me. However, Ditech told me that they would now submit the request via email. I called Ditech back the following day on XX/XX/XXXX to confirm that they emailed the request. They told me that they added the email to their notes and that it would go through at the end of the day. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted the District to see if they finally received my refund request from Ditech via email. They told me they had not and checked their records all the way back to XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I called Ditech and they told me that they could not determine if they had sent an email and their notes indicated that they would FAX a request. I told them this was unacceptable and they refused to connect me with a supervisor and claimed their back-end \" research \\'\\' department was handling the issue. I gave them the email again and begged them to send the District an email requesting the refund and they told me to call back the next day to see if the email would finally be sent.

I also need Deutsche Bank \\'s help to verify documents and emails sent from your client server account from around XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nYou employed XXXX XXXX XXXX during the time I, as a co-Trustee, opened up an account titled The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in or around XX/XX/XXXX. Initially, I sent in a complaint XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX because I thought they purchased all of your accounts and liabilities when XXXX XXXX moved over to XXXX XXXX XXXX. In their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, their attorney, XXXX XXXX, asked that I direct my inquires to Deutsche Bank. Honestly, she seemed to oversimplify the issue into a personal matter between myself and XXXX XXXX. They believe that because I was not invited to a XX/XX/XXXX, that my feelings were hurt so significantly that I would maliciously complain. \\n\\nFar from the truth. XXXX XXXX had an opportunity to address the issue honestly when I did call him as my stock broker to ask \" Why would he invited my wife to his home when we had an agreement that there would be no private dealings? \\'\\' He had the choice to say he made a choice to invite her and not me and that he would understand if I wanted to transfer the account. Instead, he first lied about not knowing I was not invited. And then he chose to be highly offensive threatening me and intimidating with statements including my XXXX year old son. \\n\\nI ASKED XXXX XXXX FOR HELP : XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX appear to be unwilling to contain the behavior of XXXX XXXX who continues to make false reports to his branch manager at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and also is now making false reports about threatening voice mails. I never left any threatening voice mails. To date, all my complaints have been in written form through this agency and or to the managers and compliance officers at XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nHowever, I initially complained to XXXX XXXX when he was Deutsche Bank regarding the muni bonds interest rate being below what was agreed when he sold me on the product. The interest rates were supposed to be 1.75 % and 3 % respectively. Instead, they appeared to be below XXXX percent which made no sense. XXXX XXXX said he wanted to focus my attention on making money in private equity funds. He sent me various proposals between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, but they required minimums of {$250000.00} to {$500000.00}. Also, I had no prior experience with private equity so it appeared he was disappointed when I could not invest in these products. \\n\\nHowever, he made false claims in his legal brief that he did not ever allow any more investments. XX/XX/XXXX he sent me a XXXX XXXX XXXX from your client server. XX/XX/XXXX, from your client server, XXXX XXXX sent me a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This was about 9 months into our working together. \\n\\nHowever, in late XX/XX/XXXX, after he was informed of my marital dissolution, he began to develop a relationship with the co-Trustee, through his wife XXXX XXXX. For reasons that are not clear to me other than that XXXX XXXX, who is estranged to me, is a minor celebrity on television, he wanted to become closer to her and despite his agreement and understanding that finances were a big concern in our dissolution, he engaged in dialogues with my estranged wife and co-Trustee of the XXXX XXXX XXXX. The discussions were memorialized by text messages that XXXX XXXX actually turned over in superior court on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nAnd then, apparently, on XX/XX/XXXX, the same day I was mediating my dissolution case, he directed his wife XXXX XXXX to contact XXXX, the co-Trustee. This is confirmed by XXXX in her letter to me dated XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX made representations in his legal brief on XX/XX/XXXX, that he was not in contact with either myself nor XXXX XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX. However, he clearly is not addressing the fact that his wife is in communication and under Rule 5-100, in the dissolution case, XXXX XXXX \\'s legal team may not be coordinating other latter legal events to gain an advantage. The same holds true for XXXX XXXX and for XXXX XXXX legal team. There is an inherent conflict of interest in that XXXX XXXX participated in both the breach of their duties to me and the Trust as well as posting a defaming photograph with my full name in full public view at their prominent XXXX XXXX Building. I believe Deutsche Bank also has office in the same location. \\n\\nDespite the fact that in a background check, you would or should have determined that XXXX XXXX has a history of dealing with complaints on his character by making and filing false reports, and the understanding that XXXX XXXX directed my concerns to your company, I am enclosing supporting documentation with the hopes that your company will help me in dealing with this extremely combative and unprofessional individual. He also has a history of \" muddying the waters \\'\\' in litigation with false statements. For instance, in his legal papers that XXXX XXXX helped him to prepare, he says that he more or less was hesitant to handle our family \\'s money. Yet, an email from your server on XX/XX/XXXX shows him soliciting a mortgage deal through XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nHe is also willing to mislead Judges in civil court. He made false statements, according to XXXX XXXX, my estranged wife and co-trustee, that \" she is in fear of me. \\'\\' In fact, we had a successful co-parenting relationship from XX/XX/XXXX and during that time period in XX/XX/XXXX. It is well documented and there is a joint custody agreement in place. \\n\\nIt appears that he keeps using his own unfortunate marital disputes to color how XXXX XXXX should deal with hers. I am not clear about what your company or XXXX XXXX responsibilities are in these strange situations, but at least I would expect the firms to tell the employee to simply stop it. See the attached declarations from his XXXX XXXX and her friends and doctors to gain insight into my points. \\n\\nFrom XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, I had concerns for my estranged wife who was also making statements about certain events that turned out to be false and misleading me to be believe she was harassed. The bottom line is that neither XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX have been truthful on their initial responses to my concerns. I believe XXXX XXXX used and continue to use his prominent position at your bank as well as XXXX XXXX to gain credibility advantages. The facts eventually will show that he acted maliciously and aggressively towards me personally and breach his fiduciary duties from XX/XX/XXXX and again in XX/XX/XXXX and again in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The evidence also will show text messages that indicate conspiracy to alienate me from my son, XXXX. Please note the text message on XX/XX/XXXX whereby XXXX XXXX convoluted his personal concerns about the complaint I made at XXXX XXXX against his behavior with what he says to my estranged wife \" We are just concerned for you and XXXX. \\'\\' It implies that in his dialogue, he involves him self in my custody. And he went so far as to file a false police report around XX/XX/XXXX for which the investigation seemed to go no where despite my reaching out on several occasion to the XXXX XXXX Police. In court documents, he claims that it was XXXX XXXX who told him to make a false police report. They must have based their concerns on statements XXXX XXXX made to XXXX XXXX, the branch manager. I spoke with her on two occasions and I was always professional and after speaking to me around this time, she admitted to making the decision to post a security notice based on XXXX XXXX \\'s statement that I threatened him and his family, but did not believe it to be true for why would she remove the security picture within 45 minutes of our discussion. She was also concerned that two bankers relayed the picture to me which is technically defamation. I have reason to believe that XXXX XXXX is seeking revenge and making up false information to create a defense. His focus is on the funds, but he has made statements to the co-Trustee that he harbored some sort of vendetta against me about the stock market. If he felt this way during his time at your bank, why did he not raise the issue professionally whereby I could have taken my business elsewhere and avoided this legal problem and the awkward position of dealing with his conspiracy to separate me from my son? I have second belief, through the mediation, that XXXX XXXX no longer wants to have any friendship or professional relationship with either XXXX or XXXX XXXX. However, today, she agreed to use best efforts to keep our son XXXX away from them both. Finally, the documents pertaining to case number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX vs. XXXX XXXX XXXX are presented to provide evidence of his prior similar conduct. Also, it shows evidence through declarations from doctors to his ex-wife that he has history of aggression, violence, and especially there are statements about his willingness to grab his wife by the throat in front of his at the time, XXXX year old son. He also allegedly tried to strike his ex-wife with his car. He was ordered into PACT to contain his anger issues. I do not feel that my doing business with you, or your employee and setting up the account under your company should have put me at such a severe disadvantage or legal problems. I expected to be able to transfer the account away from your company and subsequently XXXX XXXX without issue. And certainly no fees. The problem is that XXXX XXXX set up CDs and I have no idea if there are surrender fees in order to move them to another bank. Also, XXXX XXXX continues to protect XXXX XXXX without carefully reviewing his past history of violence and  making false statements to gain litigation advantage. \\n\\nIF THERE WAS TRUTH TO BEING THREATENED, WHY THE MOCKERY Please pay special attention to the tone of his text messages on XX/XX/XXXX whereby he actually says the situation is \" ( laughable ) \\'\\' and in his court documents he makes the admission that \" he is not intimidated by me. \\'\\' Please see the attached text messages with XXXX and/or his wife \\'s handwriting so the Judge can understand what the documents are. XXXX and XXXX are in BLUE and the co-Trustee, XXXX XXXX, in WHITE. \\n\\nBoth parties seem to find the predicament they created for me funny. If XXXX XXXX was really afraid as he now says he was during that exact time, how come none of the communications he shares matches his narrative? \\n\\nIt also seems to underscore why XXXX XXXX initially reported to me that she felt pushed into the situation by XXXX XXXX. You can see that she is focus on auditions and our son XXXX. Meanwhile, XXXX XXXX mocks the co-trustee, me, knowing that it will gain favor with XXXX XXXX since we are divorcing. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX USES HIS POSITION OF POWER FOR HIS PERSONAL PLEASURE : XXXX XXXX appears to have been getting some twisted personal pleasure out of the hurt and discomfort the situation he and his wife created. Also, if they were honest in their concerns for their safety, why is there nothing in the texting between themselves and XXXX XXXX? Why, if I clearly know how to use the services of this agency and to speak with compliance, would I need to resort to such tactics as XXXX XXXX casually describes in his documents that only when his bosses told him to call the police, he did. Why would a grown man of about XXXX years old not hang up and dial XXXX? When he makes these statements, and certainly this is likely documented by XXXX XXXX Police, it appears that he and XXXX XXXX are trying to cover up for his actions. I believe, according to XXXX XXXX, he is a managing director and has people under his direction. He also, from what he says, has clients of significant wealth. He stated he has XXXX XXXX and the owner of XXXX and even the head of XXXX television has clients. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX, based on their letters from XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX seem to unwilling to contain his aggressive behavior towards me. My account is still stuck there. \\n\\nCONVOLUTING PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS : Consider that XXXX XXXX used his Deutsche Bank email account for both personal and business emails to his clients including his political agenda. Yet, in his court documents, he claims that my complaining on or around XX/XX/XXXX was not valid because I left a voice mail with his cell phone and not at the office. Yet, he used his cell phone to call me - a complete contradiction. In that XX/XX/XXXX solicitation, XXXX XXXX says in the email to call XXXX XXXX \\'s cell phone. And contradictions were wisely pointed out by XXXX XXXX part of the filed and documented paperwork from case XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nAgain, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX make this about a personal issue of being slighted without looking into the nature of his dealings with the co-Trustee and the veracity of their text messages vs. their statements they provided to compliance. \\n\\nNothing adds up except that they have a mutual interest in harming my legal status with both my marriage case and also my standing within the finance community and within the community in general. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX is a series 7 licensed individual and his veracity is expected to be 100 percent on all matters when it comes to dealing with his client and their investments. Had Deutsche Bank vetted XXXX XXXX, I do not believe he would be in this position to bully me currently.',\n",

       " 'In the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX - sometime around XX/XX/XXXX - Specialized Loan Servicing ( SLS ) of  XXXX XXXX, CO advised me in writing that I was delinquent in payments for the mortgage I have on rental property ( formerly a personal residence ). The mortgage with SLS ( which was purchased by SLS from another company ) is for P & I only. I do not recall when my husband and I originally closed on this mortgage, but I believe it was somewhere around XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. SLS is attempting to collect monies for an escrow to pay property taxes and insurance. I have always paid my mortgage payments on time, and for the past several years, the payment has been made prior to the due date. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, SLS would repeatedly call me when I was at work wanting to collect funds from me to bring the account current, even though I told them I did not owe the debt. I had to request they cease communicating with me by phone because I was getting called multiple times per day/per week from their employees. After that request, everything was done in writing. \\n\\nI have always paid my own property insurance and property taxes. Proof of payment has been provided to them via my attorney. However SLS continues to pursue and has been reporting to various consumer reporting agencies that I am delinquent in the payment of my mortgage which has negatively impacted my credit score. SLS has repeatedly failed to provide documentation that proves I owe them monies for an escrow account, has failed to provide information as to the specific paragraph in the original mortgage that states I owe monies for an escrow account. \\n\\nUnable to resolve the situation on my own, I retained an attorney in XX/XX/XXXX to settle this matter with SLS, but SLS was refusing to speak with the attorney. I then retained a different attorney in XXXX of XXXX. My current attorney has made repeated requests to SLS to remove this reporting from consumer reporting agencies, but SLS failed to do so, and her requests for proof of the debt have gone unanswered. \\n\\nSLS recently sold the mortgage to another company, and I am concerned that this new company will also be reporting a debt, that I believe, is not owed. I would like SLS to remove all reporting of this debt from my credit report until such time it is proven that I do in fact owe the debt. I have no problem paying my debts - I have a problem with false reporting. \\n\\nI am hoping that you can do something to get SLS to stop reporting an unproven debt to the various consumer reporting agencies. I continue to receive monthly statements from SLS that shows a past due balance ; SLS continues to apply my P & I payments to an escrow account then applies the remaining balance to my P & I. \\n\\nCommunication I received from my attorney on XX/XX/XXXX indicating, per SLS : \" They said that as of today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) that there is a balance due to them in the sum of {$830.00}. They say that {$83.00} of that amount is for late fees. The remaining funds reflect payments due in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThey acknowledge that they have received the sum of {$170.00} that has not been applied yet. I instructed them that they need to apply that all to the principal and apply that as of the date that they received it. \\'\\' Lastly, SLS is now sending communications of the debt to my husband \\'s place of employment, rather than to our home address.',\n",
